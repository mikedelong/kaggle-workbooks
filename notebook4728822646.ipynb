I am not the woman who is controlled by emotion or makes emotional decisions. I analyze and wait before making decisions. I do not represent the examples he gives where emotional arguments persuade my thoughts. I didn’t buy into the Covid fear. I don’t buy into every new sensational news story that’s covering and distracting from the quiet moves that are being made under the table. I don’t have to be stoic to be logical. Look at Candace. She is feminine and emotional, and yet also logical and a strong leader. It’s not mutually exclusive. And that’s what I think Andrew Tate is saying. That, I can’t get behind.\\n\\nI do agree with a lot of things Andrew Tate says. But some things I just can’t. And maybe I’m an anomaly as women go. I was in a marriage where I had to be the logical leader. My exh was an emotional, aggressive, abuser. \\n\\nI will say, though, that now that I am with a man who is a hardworking man who leads (I swear, his very presence controls the energy in a room and I see it even among other men and his friends) and provides and has control of his emotions (meaning he can be vulnerable with me but the world doesn’t get to see the side I see), I am noticing that I am relaxing into my emotions more.

When I heard from \\\"Pol Pol 1005\\\" I had to laugh!  They are a desperate people who are still waiting to be potty-trained. They TELL you they are important, if they were - they wouldn't have to run in numbers and scream & rant continuously.  NEVER stating their real issues that they personally feel.  It's always a GROUP! That is not how life works - Generally, most mature people have learned that being able to stand up against stupid things all by themselves - they best be able to defend the accusations.  Most people love their families, neighborhoods, their government & a peaceful way of life.  As an adult, they finally achieve it if they temper their behavior of choosing to riot!  These people learned nothing from growing up.  They cannot tell you what it really is that they are fighting.  \\n\\nI watched this 3 mo after you filmed it - Nov 17, 2023!!  And that upset them.  They are still trying to win their childhood games by throwing temper-tantrums, only today they include riots & destruction, but blame it on other people.  Who gives a damX if they approve - it's a sign to me that we are right in our opinion of the witless and the shiftless.  They are representing everything I despise in the radicals.  They don't have a concern for beliefs, they only have concern for what they can destroy & will go to hell & back to try to destroy it.  I'd like to see what they'd do if they came after me where I live.  They'd find out really quick what goes on in REAL AMERICA!  WE  DEMAND  RESPECT  FROM  EACH  OTHER!  If they can't live within those parameters, get the hell out of our country!  They are an insidious, diseased and destructive people that are no better than the HAMAS,  alive in Israel.  I suggest they go over there to the front lines and do their ranting there - they might see REALITY of what's important in this WORLD!!  Self respect, manners, morals, ethics, honesty, peaceful behavior and keep their ideologies to themselves.  Their riots are getting old - what I find amazing is that there is not one of these people that have the courage to stand up, ALL ALONE!  They always run in PACKS!

Before watching this if you had asked me were these 2 people to have attempted to sit for as long as they did discussing very topical & sensitive current issues & problems we as a species & society are finding ourselves thrown into the middle of I would have laughed & said no way they would be able to without disagreeing to the point where 1 of them couldn't continue with the conversation but it has given me hope for the future & although I don't particularly like Andrew tate nor do I agree with some of his extreme views & the same can be said about candace too, I as a rational,  logical male human can still watch\\u002flisten to these 2 & take plenty of positives away from the whole thing.

Jesus gave us the chance to have a new heart- have his heart. So the moment you are born again and filled with the holy ghost YOU ARE ALREADY FORGIVEN. To think you need to keep asking the Lord for forgiveness  means you don't think he did a good enough job when he died for us all? \\n\\nJesus looks at you and sees you in his image. The biggest lie being sold for generations is that you need to keep trying to be perfect like God and need to keep 'repenting' in order for God to see you in a better light\\n\\nGod doesn't want you to spend your life on this earth constantly asking for forgiveness for your sins etc. You are already made whole and perfect in him the moment you give your life to our Lord and Savior ❤\",\"The Tate brothers understand that a loving, beautiful wife and angelic kids are the dream for men to aspire to. They also understand it is just that; a dream. The USA, UK, Australia and Canada have a culture steeped in hedonism, materialism, and straying from God. \\n\\n60% of marriages divorce\\n80% of divorces are initiated by women\\n90% of child custody is awarded to women\\n97% of alimony payments go from a man to a woman\\n\\nI cannot count how many stories I have heard of men that are suicidal after a divorce, losing access to their kids, losing their faith in humanity and God, losing their house, car, and 401k, and losing access to ANY dating or companionship as women avoid broke men like the plague.\\n\\nSo, when you realise the dream of a functioning, happy family is a distant fantasy, the Tate brothers look to the next best lifestyle for men - which is to become good looking, fit, wealthy, high-status, confident, charismatic. All data shows this is what women want in men. That allows men to have casual hookups with beautiful women without marrying and therefore risking their life's work and savings. \\n\\nI can't say the Tate brothers are wrong.\",\"yeah some I agree, some I don't. move on\",\"It took me soo long to find this interview....definitely shadow banned\",\"Glad this hasn’t been taken down 😅\",\"Was surprised she is 34, queen looks 20.\",\"I just thinks its interesting how he says he does not find people that define others by their past to be virtuous however he has no problem attacking single mothers for exactly that.

True Christianity is demonstrated in places like Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Ethiopia, Egypt. All of these countries are eslamic countries except Ethiopia. They face extreme operation and descrimination because they are Christians but they keep their faith. Just look for videos about christanilty in the middle east. The orthodox Christians in libya that were beheaded by ISIS we ki**ed because they refused to convert to Islam. He could even look into history on how Islam became the major religion in middle east, which is through killing, vs the Christian faith got passed down and got strengthened through the martyrs like st George, who was born in modern day Turkey and the disciplines of Jesus Christian facing persecution and eventually being ki**ed. There is so much to learn. Especially from the eastern orthodox churches in th3 middle east and Africa.\",\"It felt like this just became an echo chamber in the end. Started off great but then turned into just two opinions from people who know only a small portion of the world if you take into account how many people there are. It’s just opinions. Just like this is my opinion. We all have different perspectives. I have met gay guys in relationships who do not always just talk about sex. That was really funny. Essentially saying a gay couple is abnormal because all they talk about it sex. Like you know EVERY SINGLE GAY COUPLE OUT THERE😂 \\n\\nI do believe it we just started realising that everyone has their own truth. God surely wouldn’t create a world with all of everything in it to condemn people for having certain feelings and desires or wait, it’s a test isn’t it😂 \\nAnd for them to speak on behalf of what God wants. Surely that’s dangerous. Until god comes down here and tell us what they haha key word as we don’t know if god is man or woman, no one can really say what he wants. They can only share their perspective. Which is so cool. So interesting to hear another’s perspective but is it really serving the world by believing perspective is the gospel truth.

So much to say, but may i please say that yes, you are \\\"feeling\\\" something, but as i have listened, Andrew said himself that the culture is so different, and they love and respect each other much better.  Why turning away from The only Savior that exists? Jesus said that HE IS THE ONLY WAY, THE  DOOR TO GOD. Any other way is considered to be a thief, no way in. My heart breaks, because Jesus's heart breaks over people using the lack of other's intimacy with Jesus and not feeling Him as a legitimate reason for abandoning the True Savior who paid a terrible price for us.

Covenant Marriage is a covenant between a man and woman and GOD and has absolutely nothing to do with a legal contract made with government. Marriage and family were first established, ordained and governed by GOD not the state. God then via Covenant Marriage should be the ONLY 3rd party to the marriage union and not government.  Covenant Marriage is what was practiced in America prior to the Civil War and the freeing of black slaves. After the civil war government overstepped the boundary of separation of church and state when applying secular laws to the religious institutions of Marriage and Family.  Racist were fearful of an increase in interracial marriages and wanted a way to CONTROL that situation so they devised legal marriage and the marriage license.  Whenever an interracial couple then applied for a marriage license it could be denied using supporting laws that made interracial marriages illegal.  Following the timeline from the beginning of legal marriage in America til today we can see the other corruptions that followed along with legal marriage. No fault divorce (which is entirely unscriptural), corrupt family courts and laws governing custody of children creating parental alienation, corrupt child support laws ( a criminal enterprise of racketeering and extortion made legal by the state) making criminals out of parents while creating revenue for the state, abortions on demand murdering off 3800-4000 children per day in America alone, and now government wishes to redefine marriage altogether via homosexual or same sex marriages.  All Godless abominations that have come about after God was tossed out of the marriage union and replaced with government.  Government via Legal Marriage has destroyed the 'religious institutions' of Marriage and Family.  Families make up the fundamental building blocks of ANY civilized society so to destroy families is to destroy a nation. Christian America needs to get government out of our marriage union by collectively rejecting legal marriage and returning to Covenant marriage.  As for Non-Christians - leave legal marriage to them.\",\"He referred to himself in the third person and people like him? What a loser!\",\"He loves hearing himself talk.

Also there are studies and statistics that proved to show male baby’s and men in general are equally if not more prom to emotional distress and aren’t able to cope with them in to adulthood because it’s assumed that woman are the more emotional ones. War has also proven to be just as worse for the normal citizens as the soldiers since they (especially woman and children) are used against whom ever the war is against and are the victims of more aggressive ans gruesome rape crimes children are being exploited ans those that are in the power position are men. Some woman are also but they are in no position that is the main focus part to decide whether war is an option or not. I think we are all simply victims to media propaganda against all and everything that would make life easier for EVERYONE no matter their believes and choice of lifestyle and against health in general because it’s profitable for the ones that already are on the top who “surprisingly” are all men. No matriarchy to find anywhere.

A good therapist should keep you accountable and help you dig deep into your tough emotions so you can own it and not the emotions owning you (until you can do that yourself).

The fear of God the Bible says is the beginning of wisdom.  God is also of love and mercy.  We seek him to understand this.  In Christianity we understand that it is his love in sending Christ that will eventually unite mankind. This won't happen till the evil in this world is subversed.

One one side  we have folks talking to children about choosing their gender at 4 and encouraging children to make permanent modifications to their body before they are old enough to make that decision, then on this side we have folks touting the extremes that, in my opinion, literally lead to the other extreme. As in, we have folks telling people that in order to be a man you \\\"must\\\" be x and in order to be a woman you \\\"must\\\" be x. Thus people are saying, well if I don't fit that expectation I must be something else... We are creating more problems in an attempt to address an existing problem that excessive stereotypes created. I do not fit the stereotype of a feminine woman. I also know how to skin an animal and kill and process my own chickens for meat. I'm very proud of being able to do that. It's not exactly feminine by the stereotype, but it is a quality trait that I have. I also don't love to dress up generally. I would rather wear jeans and sit however the hell I want, and I hate shopping. I also only have 4 sets of shoes in my closet the majority of the time, and I wear them until they break. I am still a woman even though I do not fit the feminine stereotype. The same applies to men. They do not have to meet societies crazy stereotypes to be called a man. I always hated the statements \\\"be a man,\\\" or \\\"Act like  lady.\\\" Who gets to define what that even means? Stereotypes and people's perception of those stereotypes... that is what defines it. We just need to let people be who they are so long as they aren't harming anyone, and mind our own. If people want to have the views that ya'll have on what it means to be a woman or a man, I'm a-ok with that, but people can have those views without looking down on folks who don't see it the same and without putting your views on other people. Not all women want a stereotypically masculine man. I want a physically masculine man, but I also want a man who isn't afraid to be a human and express his struggles and emotions. I feel that many men struggle with addiction because they are taught to hide and suppress their emotions their entire life, and essentially told it isn't ok to be human. I personally find that much more dangerous to society and to the family dynamic than the risk of having our men not be \\\"man enough.\\\"\",\"hahaha😹What worse can happen to Dumb Prince than end up at MM & Doria’s hands? \\nThrow Harold on Tate’s \\nhands for a full week!!!\\nHe’ll sure will wake him up🤣🥳👏Please Do🙏\",\"Loved this, genuinely brought tears to my eyes 🥹\",\"Listen Andrew, your life is on display bc YOU chose to post these hideous videos for the world to see.

If I start with the fictional, and nonfiction books that many like to read to pick moves from both characters that help design how the people function in life. What so strange about that, is how each individual want to function by, that got nothing to do with what they describe in those two books.

Materialism is the flaw of the West and it does not bring happiness and joy.  I get that love is submission.  I mean love is what makes people do things that they don't want to do.  That is why love is truly a weakness because if you love something you submit to it.  He teaches how to keep toxic women who only love themselves how to manipulate them and keep them around because they love their reputation and not being a label more than they would being with the individual.  Loving money will get you to submit to it and obey its rules.  Loving your reputation will cause you to defend it with stride.  Love is the most powerful ally and can get anyone to do anything you want.  When someone threatens to take what you love away, that is the only way fear exists.  Love is the ultimate submission and it makes humans scrape shit off of the sidewalks and it will keep women putting up with all the garbage that these ideologies put people through.  Compassion is what is always needed.  When someone loves you, you can control them.  If they hate you, you can only do so much with that.  To me love is more powerful than any weapon on the planet because you can get anyone to do anything for love and passion.  \\n\\nCompassion is more important because it means that there are barriers to what you do to others.  Love is unlimited and dangerous.  Controlling what people love just means that those will resent you.  Having them love you is what matters but what you ascribe meaning to matters because it is a seed and will bear fruit onto the plains of existence and over time it will reveal the reality through evidence of the seeds.

If you come from that circumstance it means neither your neighbors, nor your own parents are good people to take advice on how to do well in life from. They don’t know how the world works. They don’t know how to improve their situation or anyone’s situation. And not because nobody told them, it’s likely rather because they refused to listen (if they were born healthy in an economy with a relatively free market in a wealthy country). If they did, they would be well off. Because you make money only by solving problems for other people, making people’s lives better. Sounds harsh, but That’s just the truth for 99.999999% of people. Essentially everyone who doesn’t have a pharmaceuticals company, but even there the few sour apples ruin the perception of the rest. So, If someone who’s well off tells you how you could improve your situation and they are someone who you would deem morally sound enough, that is when you have to listen and recognize your programming is off if you think „oh well, fuck you, what do you know about my struggle?“. ESPECIALLY when they sit in a manicured garden on a large estate with a white picket fence and you aren’t. They know, you don’t. They actually know something that might help you that you don’t know. That’s how I see it. It doesn’t make sense to take advice from people who exist in a situation you don’t want to be in. It doesn’t make sense to change your world view or behavior according to those people, Because if you follow their advice, you end up where they are. And they don’t know. Their opinions are likely to be misinformed and wrong in many ways. Listen only to the people who are where you want to go. „By their fruits you will know them“.\",\"gay\",\"I look forward to seeing you both in good health and happy with both your lots I'm life.

Some of these rich people and politicians are actually convicted pedos who had powerful connections and had their record wiped but I don’t see any of these feminists protesting against them.\",\"The Transgender question that Andrew asks about has a simple answer.  Children who have transitioned and have now grown up and decided it was the wrong thing and have even taken legal action in UK and USA, have made a simple request - that children are not burdened with the right to make such life changing decisions.  In other words they want the law changed so that children are NOT allowed to transition.  When their brains are fully developed, perhaps they can have the right to change their own body, but the 99.99% of population should NOT be forced to agree with transgenderism  and certainly should not be forced to use pronouns.  \\n\\nIf it is the view that in a democracy an individual has the right to do whatever they want with their own body, then an individual also has the right not to agree with the concept of transitioning.  Even Iran, which is an Islamic country with a written constitution, based on Quran and teachings of the Holy Prophet (PBUH)'s family,  has considered the legal rights of those who want to transition going back to the early 1980s at least, and they have considered the opinion  of the medical community, but one thing that ALL agree with and why transgenderism has become so controversial is because children are being targeted and  the state have actively taken over the raising of children and have actively sought ways to keep the parents away and isolate the children.   \\n\\nIt reminds me of men who used to offer sweets to children and try to befriend them and then abuse them, away from the safety of the family.  The state unfortunately are using the school system and the healthcare systems to take over the upbringing and brainwashing of children.  It is in short COMMUNISM - the replacement of the old age, universal, religious institution of the family and father and husband with the man made and man controlled STATE.\",\"Shame on you for giving away 3 hrs of your life for this guy, you should have been abducted by him a forcefully at your will be exploited as he did to his victims.

Now in days everything we see on tv isn’t always what it seems people, it is all a mirage, here today and gone tomorrow. Not only that, when you have the money you can orchestrate whatever you please to further your agenda, when fighters want to sell tickets to their fights they need to spice things up a bit, they need to make a little noise to bring some attention to their battle, once they cash in they’re off in to the sunset. Social media, as he mentioned, he understands how the internet works and when you understand it you have to take advantage while you can, and so does everyone, Candace here knows how that works, that’s why she has him on her podcast here, he’s creating the drama and everyone pays up to get a piece of it. Eventually another one will get his or her opportunity to stir up the media waters and everyone will share on those profits and on to the next best thing. They are all in it for the money folks, they make you believe what they want you to believe no different than the people they are supposedly fighting against.

Why aren’t they in Africa or in any real hells on earth and fighting for those that are truly starving? People here in the “developed” world are more than happy and well fed brainwashed or not, there are places in this world that are truly suffering and starving every day, who gives a crap about a person here eating a bag of chips while staring at a screen being brainwashed. Common Andrew, snap out of it, the same system or matrix that you claim to be fighting, also has you already living a lie, a counterfeit existence believing that you are doing the right thing.

I am fortunate enough to live in a mostly Islamic country in a traditional family. Like Andrew said, the problems you have there are so far removed from the reality here in more traditional countries. However, since social media is everywhere, they do creep in silently. I am grateful for podcasts like these so I can learn what to look out for and how I can protect my children from it. Praying for the remaining sane brothers and sisters in the West to stay strong. \\n\\nAs for the Nuclear family. I'm sure Andrew will learn along the way (or have learnt more possibly?) that Islam also promotes nuclear family bonded in marriage 😅. And it goes with his situation since in Islam he can build nuclear families with 2,3 or 4 wives (and have 10 Andrews 😂) if he's capable of providing moral and physical support for all of them like he says he can (if he can't provide for them then the Quran explicitly said to have only one wife if the Man can't be just in this manner. so Islam is not against monogamy either, but different types of people have choices to choose from.)\\n\\nMaybe he's still thinking of marriage as only a monogamous marriage which doesn't fit his situation and that's why he's still reluctant. It was rather funny watching Candice wishing marriage for him like a caring sister to her brother and Andrew sheepishly trying to answer 🤣.\\n\\nAnyway, this is amazing.

But it made me very uneasy to my core.\\nHere is what I've come up with as the reason behind it, followed by my previously mentioned argument against it:\\n\\nI've believed that people know the truth when they hear it for a long time. I believe people are uncomfortable in their own body, I've been there. But the sentence \\\"I was born in the wrong body\\\" has never rung right to me.\\nIf you feel how you feel,, different than the medium of  your gender imposed identity, I do not see why that should lead to the conclusion that your body is wrong. And it doesn't! Not alone. Cause the people advocating for the changing from your biological incling, say that these \\\"standart gender ideas\\u002froles\\\" don't fit, are not inclusive. \\nI agree. \\nScience agrees.\\nPeople are on a curve,  where the extremes are predictable and the middle is the same, yet generalizations have been derived from these curves.\\nAnd to the individual this means that a men's brain can look more like stereotypical females brains and visa versa.\\nThis is a huge factor behind the fight for equality that has been happening. Your gender does not, on this curve, in truth, necessarily define you in any way in your sense of outcome, proclivity or preference.\\n\\nBut here is my argument against the mutilation of how nature has brought you forth:\\nIf you agree with this,, that gender is on a scale and the nature of a person is personally relevant and not relevant by assumption:\\nWhy does that conclude to anyone having to change their body?\\nI strongly feel that if you are in a female of male body, with more generally found male or female preferences,,  THATS OKAY. But why is that not okay to have in your natural body?\\n\\nIf we want to see how male and female roles can be inhabited by the person most suited to it, why not own who you are in the body that is yours?\\nWould it not be an amazing step for humanity is everyone did what they were best suited for? \\nIf you feel you're suited for a career that was previously viewed as something men could do, or women, but you are of the opposite sex and are literally better suited for it,, GO DO IT. Would it not set back the advancements we've made if we pretent you NEED to be a certain gender to LIVE THAT TRUTH.\\n\\nBe who you physically are, live it proudly and do what you do best.\\nBut don't undergo dangerous and superficial surgeries to be able to be who you are wired to be, because that is not defeating gender roles, it it enforcing them to the point  of threatening your lives.\",\"58:13 stupidity instead of haunting corrupt autoritarian officials we should learn to haunt and farm like people bfr 10 000 years ago\",\"Because you blaspheme even against your own god. Now; a few things Christians should now to stand in confidence: Muhammad mentions, Christ Jesus, by name which means the Quran was written after his day. It also states that Jesus's followers will be blessed at the day of resurrection. The first bold face lie is that \\\"Adam\\\" was taught the names of the animals rather than having named them. Next obvious bold faced lie is that the angels left heaven in Genesis, because they saw that the daughters of men were fair to look upon, came down and took wives of their own choosing. Whereas  the Quran states; the angels left God because God commanded the angels to bow down and worship the humans. Every Hebrew founded belief knows this is clearly not the same god.

There is a degree of narcissism a man needs to carry for masculinity to other men but you spread your narcissism internationally and think it's okay.

Pakistan lost 80k lives , 3 times more than USA itself whose war it was to begin with. and now more than ever the only ally USA has had in this region of Asia, the ally that told USA about Osama bin Laden, and he was captured , thus ending the decades long war.  now more than ever Pakistan needs USA because of the changing world orders and a war in europe in which INDIA openly supports Russia, china i don't know but is neutral, and we are being attacked from both side by India and Afghanistan and from within .  because Pakistan's leadership in being loyal to USA does what USA tells em to. and now they have abandoned us and even go as far as supporting terrorists in India. \\n\\nTrump promised that he would be there to mediate between Pakistan and India about Kashmir a disputed region, disputed regions cause wars,  and this disputed region according to united nations charters has clearly been ruled as : the people of the region should get to vote, and India by using force has ignored united nations, they keep out maneuvering USA at every turn by lies and what not, their economy was far below ours because we worked hard and we the people had no hatred towards them, but they did. and now their economy is booming and ours is on a free fall. \\n\\nwhere is our ally?

Great episod, loved it 💕💕🔥🔥\",\"Let us see the short history of early Islam? Islam initially started by mohammed as a humble initiative to gain leadership of mohamed's own qureshi tribe defeating his opponents, simply say as a small mafia group .It has been initiated and financed by Khadija, the first wife of mohammed, the wealthiest business woman in mecaa . When that so called spirit jebriel squeezed mohammed's neck 3 times, make him scary and shivering. Mohammed believed that he was attacked and possessed by a jinn. He run to Khadia and said cover me because he felt shivering scary due to that demonic attack.\\nMohammed fell down ground and water and foam came out from his mouth. As per Bible that \\\"water & foam\\\" is a sign of demonic attack.\\nIt happens when Jesus cast out demon possessed. Khadija took him to Wareka bin Nafal her cousin, an ex communicated priest from nazara christian pagan cult. (Like the present day cult JW \\u002f Mormon) Khadija & Mohammed\\nwere a so the members of that nazara christian cult of Waraqa. At first Wareqa suggested it as gabriel and Khadija confirmed it as gabriel to mohammed. Mohammed as a member of nazara pagan christian cult, the suggestion of jebriel name is just an opinion. So Khadija did a funny test to mohammed to check whether this spirit is a demon or real Jabriel. Khadija is the first to call that jinn satan as jabriel after her funny testing with mohammed. Kahdija requested\\nWarega bin Nafal to create an Arabic Gospel for mohammed .(Refer Sahih Bhukhari Hadith\\n6982, Book No 91 for well explained , full story of this small Mafia group & Arabic Gospel) That Arabic Gospel is called quran, the fake wahi from imaginary allah . Wareqa bin Nafal intentionally added all that false information in quran against Bible and give it to mohammed as wahi \\u002frevelation from allah in a daily basis.\\nIslam created by wealthy Khadija and Wareqa as a small business to mohammed . Mohammed took that moon god allah, the chief pagan idol god of his qureshi tribe and white washed , revised \\u002f remove 3 daughters of allah and declare as Quranic allah. He informed his qureshi tribe that islam is a new religion for them and he receiving wahi from the new deity, Quranic allah. He then Start to recruit pagan desert Bedouin tribals as warriors for the new religion islam as jihadi fighters with sword in their hand. The first operation of Mohammed as Jihadist leader is to raid caravan trade route and collect mafia extortion money. Latter mohammed expand his mafia business by start fight with his own quresh tribe opponents & other pagan tribes to collect war booty and theft money like gold \\u002f silver etc. Mohammed added more muslim warriors to his fold to conquer tribes and communities . Wareqa bin Nafal add more new wahi from allah in the quran, like the offer of 72 fair everlasting virgins, 24\\u002f7 erection, 70 years of continuous orgasm, 80000 cute little boy servants, milk and honey rivers, all kinds of fruits in hand pick, zam zam fresh water river, silk covered couches, gold, silver, different 7 levels of muslim paradise building all as after life reward to muslim jihadists . This offer is just for tempting and encourage desert male Bedouins to join as muslim warriors (jihadists) and this fantasy after life is a dream of every desert Bedouins is a free escape from the horrible life in the Arabian desert. Also they attracted the war booty income received as a Jihadi warrior and an assured after life. Look at the 21st century suicide bombers, the same fantasy temptation of after life control them and do the mischievous horrible attack against the humanity.\\nAlso assured jihadists that if they\\nkilled in the battle, they will receive that offer and a sudden entry to the virgin muslim paradise . This kind of deception or false fantasy rewards from allah created by Wareqa bin Nafel to exploit the ignorance of poor desert male Bedouin tribes. Mohammed start to fight with different pagan tribal communities including, pagan nazara christians @ narjan, sabians,\\nRomans @ Tabuk and Yehudis @ Yathrib\\u002f Medina . Mohammed took 20% of war booty and balance shared by their sahaba's (follower jihadists) . So everybody happy in this initial Islamic Business start up. Mohammed usually kill all male members of the tribes during the battle and took woman & girls as sex slaves to jihadists. Mahammed himself chopped heads of\\n700 Jewish males at Banu Quresh at Yathrib in one day (Now Medina). Always the most beautiful cute girl will go to Mohammed's tent.\\nThe same thing happen in 2015 when american white woman press reporter taken to ISIS caliph's tent, repeated the same war booty supply of 6th century in to the 21st century war booty supply by ISIS . Even mohammed sold sex slaves in slave market and collect money. The slaves in slave market and collect money. I he same sex slave market operated by ISIS in Raaka , Syria in 2015. Slowly Islam business expanded in medina and all over Arabia as a part of very good successful business. Specially battle of Badr is important to Mohammed. He is victorious against his own qureshi tribe opponents in Bad. Please read quran, sura 3, ayat 161& Tafseer, says about a very funny pantie theft story about mohammed did in the day of Badr. Mohammed did everything as per Khadija's advice, his boss as a successful business woman. After the death of Wareqa bin Nafel, the wahi (divine revelation) from allah completely stopped for ever . Then mohammed believe that he is not a true messenger of allah and became in suicidal thoughts, try to jump from the hill top several times to kill himself.\\nThat story is so funny, every time jebriel appear at the hill top to stop him to do that. After the death of Wareqa bin Nafal, the divine revelation (Wahi) has stopped . Mohammed became sick for 2 years due to the poisoned grill meat given by his Jewish sex slave . Why mohammed asked for writing material in his last moment of death bed ? He wish to write a new quran, something better to guide the muslims against go astray.\\nUmmer & Abu baker refused and discourage sahaba's not to give writing material to mohammed in his death bed. Mohammed knew that the quran is a book of deception and not enough to guide muslims to the right path. Again Why Ummer and Muslims kept mohammed's dead body showoff for 3 days ? Because they believe that mohamed will resurrect from dead after 3 days same like Lord Jesus Christ resurrected after 3 days. Nothing happened.\\nMuslims saw belly busted mohammed. Muslims knew that they were deceived by mohammed.\\nMuslims left islam and mohammed . Abubaker declared war against runaway Ex muslims and killed them. That is a miserable messed up story of mohammed's last hours of death bed.\\nSo let me stop here now....Please note, all sugar coated lies, sugar coated stories & news heard after that day on wards till today is all fake, make up fairy tale fabricated stories from Muslim scholars to legitimate islam with respect to Christianity . Because Muslims are always have inferiority complex with Christians, due to their embarrassing and funny stories about mohammed, allah & islam. So encourage you all educated smart Muslims, please do a sincere research on the subject of PRE ISLAMIC history of your Allah. Ask your questions to Imam or scholars. Also study, thuwarat, Injil, Zabur & do a comparison of Mohamed & Jesus of Holy Bible (Not quranic muslim Issa) Please please my humble request .Please note: the source of information taken from or documents :: Sahih hadiths :: 6 nos, Islamic history books 2 nos published by Saudi Govt wagaf board , Tafsir Jalalain (English) & Quran.

Muslims came 700 years after Jesus Christ. Muhammad the founder of that belief at the age of 50 married a 6 year old named iesha, and justified it by admitting he didn’t have sex with her till she was 9. That’s called pedophelia. This guy downs Christian’s for not speaking up as if he knows all Christians and what the Bible tells us to do. The scripture is clear what’s going to happen to this world if he ever studied it he wouldn’t  have all these questions about the things going on in it. Allah is not God people do not be deceived. Allah is a moon god look it up. The Quran was published 150-300 years after the death of Muhammad after any witness to verify anything was dead. The apostles walked talked and ate with Jesus. Most of them ran away when Jesus was being crucified, but after that they all but one were martyred for Christ. What changed? He appeared to them after he died that’s what changed. Paul who wrote most of the New Testament was a Pharisee who hunted down Christian’s and killed then. He was in charge of the very first person martyred for Christ, Stephen. But after Jesus died paul spent the rest of his life preaching Jesus Christ, and was killed for him. what changed? Jesus appeared to him that’s what changed. Anybody who reads the Quran will know it’s a man made book. God says all are equal. The Quran says if you’re not Muslim you must die. God gave all mankind free will. Muslims say if someone walks away from their belief kill them. The Bible says adultery is sin, Muslims claim it’s only sin for women. God says he without sin throw the first stone, Muslims throw gays off rooftops and stone women for adultery or speaking the name of Jesus. God says treat your wife(non plural) like Jesus treated the church. He died for the church. Muslims can have many wives and they see them less than dogs. They can beat them or discard them. Everybody hates ISIS. But the truth is ISIS follows the Quran to the T. Muslims that say they are a peaceful religion are just like those calling themselves Christian having never studied the Bible. They that say they’re peaceful have never studied the Quran because it’s anything but peaceful. \\nMuslims goal is to take over America by 2060. Which is why they are running for office in our government. And once there’s enough of them there and they win the presidency, this country is gone completely because they will vote in sharia law and anything else they want. And I don’t doubt it has everything to do with the coming antichrist. Jesus said my people perish from lack of knowledge. So to answer Tates question, the reason he is seeing so many Christian and no fight is because just like him, they don’t study the Word of God. And the fact Candace is suppose to be a Christian and she herself sitting there accepting everything this guy says who’s clearly is not only in a false cult but a very dangerous one is extremely disheartening and proving what he’s saying about Christian’s not fighting for their faith to be true.

There's another video of him talking about his PHD (pimping hoes degree) in his Hustlers University where he taught other men the process of manipulating women to do webcam for them.

This is beyond any misstep or error any of you have made in the past at the Daily Wire.. \\n\\nI’m extremely upset that you did not do your due diligence in reading the court transcripts or watching the countless hours of evidence of Andrew Tate proudly boasting and testifying about his own reprehensible treatment of girls, who are victims of human sex trafficking. The definition has not changed or been loosened: you should know what human trafficking is. Not to mention, he did this in Romania, so it does fit your narrow definition. \\n\\nHe says it himself: he targeted vulnerable girls, hid what he really wanted from them, had sex with them to emotionally manipulate and abuse them, and used other girls under his pay roll to ply initiates with alcohol and coerce them into agreeing to sexual exploitation online to strangers — for Tate’s profit. He victimized these girls, and he’s making money off sick and weak boys and also men, many who have either deluded themselves into believe Tate is their advocate or “anti-hero” as he calls himself, when he just wants their money by pimping female victims to them to control them with their lust too, or these men want to become human sex traffickers like him and make money. \\n\\nThis man is NOT against pornography or sex trafficking. You ought to know that. HE IS the demand for human victims of sex trafficking, and he’s quite literally TRAINING  HIS AUDIENCE comprised of those young boys you admitted idolize him (and supported!) and men into becoming skilled sex traffickers through his “PHD program” which stands for “Pimping Hoes,” his own words. \\n\\nYou have quite literally created a DEFENSE and a DEMAND for SEX TRAFFICKING on your platform… instead of advocating for the truth, justice for the victims and repentance. He said he is not sorry and will not apologize, and you agreed to that too… He is an unrepentant sexual predator. \\n\\nWe are ALL guilty and fall short of the Glory of God. Jesus died for our sins, took on our punishment and removed our curse of eternal damnation and death in sin if we’d repent and believe in Him. His grace is a free gift and sufficient for all our sins. \\n\\nMy heart is not just for the victims of Andrew Tate, but for you in this. You need to repent of this to the Lord, Candace.. I really hope you were a momentary victim of an unrepentant sociopath’s charisma and not a complicit actor and sympathizer with full knowledge of his crimes, and possess the courage, grit and integrity I’ve long attributed to your character to realize the mistake that you’ve made trusting and promoting this man and what he stands for, and attempt to correct the damage done.. \\n\\nToo many souls have elevated this man to level of personal savior or hero, and are sacrificing their souls for the evil world Tate stands for..\",\"Am I the only one who calls bs on all this.

Plus I'm taking care of my aging mother...all 3 of us kids had a beautiful childhood, but I'm the only one who will help, so just because you have kids doesn't mean they are going to help you. They don't owe you anything - it wasn't their choice to be born. It was yours, so obligating them into taking care of you when you get old seems a bit unfair...

They were taught that 'the white man came and rangled-up black people like animals, stole and sold them'. When i was a child i assumed that happened because i think i may have been taught that in primary school when i was about 9yrs old, so i asked adults including many from the Jamaican side of my family and they told me that most of the slaves were sold by their African leaders to other countries.

I have a large ticket of all information submitted to the FTC and have also reported their corruption to every agency possible and continue to document daily.

Growing up in an environment steeped in tension and controversy, like the Royal family, may not be considered ideal by many. His parents' tumultuous relationship, punctuated by affairs and divorce, and the tragic, untimely death of his mother amidst a paparazzi chase - all these circumstances shape an individual's experiences and feelings in profound ways. It's not for anyone else to dictate how he should or should not process these experiences.

It was very nice to witness.\",\"At the one hour and 25 minute mark, I have to question what you are talking about regarding what a man wants in a woman.   What sort of man “needs\\u002fwants” a woman to “make him look important\\u002ffeel high status and important”?  What sort of man cannot do that on his own?   How could I, as a woman, “make a man feel important”??  Why does a man want that?  Doesn’t he have his own power and ability to do that on his own?   I am not saying that a woman should not speak highly of her man, because if she is with him, and loves and respects him, she is going to do that anyway - well, I am.\\n\\nSO, what is this deal with a masculine man, needing a woman to “make him look important and to have high status”?   For me, all are equal, yet unique and status is not what it is about.  A man needs to be authentic, and real - and self-confident.  I am not interested in a man who needs me to “make him look important” - he should be able to stand on his two feet.  I’d be more interested in a man who respects me for who I am, while I am respectful of him for who he is.  \\n\\nIt is the same as my having the ability to “make someone embarrassed, or offended” - or in other words, I do not have the power to offend or embarrass someone - only they can do that for themselves.\\n\\nAndrew, you are a powerful and strong man, and I agree with your philosophy that men need to be men, and not controlled by women.  So it goes greatly against what you say, when you state that men are easily pleased - by just wanting a woman to make him feel important.   That is so contrary to what you say you stand for.  Let a man be his own man, and at the same time, live in harmony and balance with his real woman, who also respects him, and herself.\",\"Bro you are against child groomers but you allow a sex trafficker here get you priorities straight\",\"1:09:39 this is why I love my therapist.

Crazy former Marines don't write much so I'm not well written, I've forgotten all the rules. So back in the 1940's it was decided that American government was too big, too complex, and too rigid for America to stay dominate internationally and they decided America needed a reset. Since planning for this operation predates the CIA there is a loophole in our charter that allows us to operate domestically for this operation. It was decided by the highest levels of the Federal Government to run a domestic black operation. The purpose of a black operation is to destabilize the country we're operating in, we've been operating in America since about 1950. At this point we succeeded, there is going to be a revolt. By revolt I mean Nationwide rioting that's so bad it will rise to the level of open revolt. After the National revolt the civilian government will be Constitutionally Checked and Balanced by the military. You'll need about three months worth of supplies, there are going to be supply chain issues. As long as you're prepared and don't live in a big city you'll be fine. We will also be releasing the tech we've been suppressing to jump start the economy. We've been planning for this for a long time so as long as you're not a woke liberal you don't have much to worry about. Since woke liberals won't prepare for this they'll die in large numbers. We're also expecting most judges to be killed and between 50% and 75% of lawyers. The police in big cities will be barricaded in their police stations by the end of the first day and completely wiped out by the end of the third day. We have had revolts before. Both the Rodney King riots and the Watts riots where revolts and Marines had to be sent in to put them down. The governments biggest fear with the Rodney King Revolt was that it would spread to other cities, this time it will. Just to prove I got the classified briefing on the Rodney King Revolt let me tell you a story. There was a four man Marine fire team working with a LA Cop. They started taking fire from a house, I think it was second story window. The Cop told the Marines to cover him. The Marines laid down Marine Corps covering fire. They expended about 1,200 rounds and didn't hit shit, 1,200 rounds zero kills. The Marines didn't get in trouble for expending 1,200 rounds, they got in trouble for not hitting the target. \\nI wasn't allowed to watch this stuff while I was undercover, it would mess with my brainwashing, so I have a lot to catch up on. So far Candace you've only gotten one thing wrong that I've seen so far. Let me be clear on this we've been messing with EVERYONE pretty equally. We the CIA have been trying to piss everyone off. This is how we messed with black people. We told white, racist lawyers that the best way to expand the courts and make government bigger was to use black people to keep white people afraid. Those racist lawyers did one thing to keep black people down, they made sure black people didn't get an education. You said absentee fathers were the biggest problem black people have and education was number two. Not true, education is the number one problem. Also religion in government is the cause of most discrimination, period. \\nMr. Tate is a very smart man, he got most things right, you are living in the Matrix. We the CIA created it for all the right reasons, we had to save America. He's also right about Christianity, we have almost all the American churches working for the CIA, unknowingly. We fed them a variation of Nazi propaganda and replaced the Jews with gays. Don't worry going to church will only turn you into a little bit of Nazi, not a full Nazi. Since we messed with everybody and they're going to be mad I have a 15% chance of being alive in ten years. I'm a Marine and the military and vets are going to hate me too. 9\\u002f11 was a false flag operation. In America it's legal to create the need for war to fund the military industrial complex. 9\\u002f11 was the bad guys in the CIA, they have their own plans for the reset. I just pissed off and proved to certain people I really am CIA. More to come over the next six months.\",\"They didnt even put Bill Clinton under the microscope like this.

Incredible interview!!\",\"People make mistakes, and they do what they need to improve. I can understand that, but I don't agree with the way he did things. It's not because he was working with women or what they were doing, but because he said he would make them fall in love with him and manipulate them. That's what I don't agree with. He was acting like a pimp, and he's supposed to be a role model for young men? No way. Just because he's right about some things doesn't matter when he used those means to make money. I wish him well, but I don't agree with his morals. He can live his life how he wants, but he shouldn't teach men to think like that. I have a son, and I don't want him to mistreat women (manipulation, manipulating taxes he has admitted these things with his own words.)  It's okay to work with them, but don't manipulate or play with people's feelings.\\n\\n We need strong and positive men in the world, but we also need to clean up the \\\"culture\\\" there are many ways to be edgy without promoting the same things we find immoral. Good behavior is something to strive for everyone, boys and girls alike. (maybe we should make that more desirable instead of just focusing on the outcomes maybe we should focus more on the process and make that more attractive for our youth)  I believe we can be better than the negative things in the world. Just because others consume it doesn't mean you need to produce it. \\\"Breaking bad much?!\\\" The guy didn't consume it but he produced so other people would be harm by it. I mean your actions have consequences.  It's okay to admit that we are not perfect and have made mistakes in the past, but it's important to learn and grow from them.\\n\\n Deflecting or justifying bad actions  by saying other people do it.... well its just not right.  We should reflect on our past and strive to do better. Even if others are doing wrong things, it doesn't mean we should follow them. We should be responsible and mature enough to say we could have done things differently. This man is influential, and it's important for him to inspire young men with a message of growth and improvement, not something harmful like pornography. To at least admit that......\\r\\n\\r\\nI also believe it's hypocritical to say that people need to be perfect before they can be uncomfortable, or say hey there is something not making sense here. The argument is not about perfection, but about recognizing our flaws, improving ourselves, and making better choices. That's the main issue here. reflection is an important human quality to have. These are my thoughts I don't have anything against this guy just don't feel he is the right person to lead our young men. \\n\\nThanks for the interview. :)\",\"🙌\",\"Y’all.

The next video he is bragging about taking the life savings of lonely, albeit stupid, men.\\n\\nAgain, not against him, but if you take all of that and put it together its clear his business model is largely built upon leveraging troubled disenfranchised men for their money and then using that money to maintain wealth.\\n\\nIf he doesn't think he should feel bad then why refuse to admit it?\",\"I think the CV19 experiment was also an attack on Christians as they banned church get togethers while allowing us to go to Big Box stores with the purpose of disrupting our Sunday routine of worship and reflection.

I appreciated the interview, and am still not convinced he did anything illegal, but his character is not as hyped as so many believe.

These two are just very “smart”, diplomatic, articulate, political, religious and slightly narcissistic people that are able to make words sound pretty, strong and factual.

He wouldn’t bring it up till he sleeps with them first bc it would scare them off. He would tell them they were getting 50% of the profits and would lie and said 30% went to taxes and would give them super confusing “tax forms” which were just fake forms… as a way to steal their money.

Most of them haven't even heard the true gospel, let alone actually been born again. \\n\\nSo of course when society shifts and goes against what Christianity teaches, they either \\\"leave the faith\\\" (that they were never in), or still claim to be Christians, but approve of things the Bible condemns, like homosexuality, feminism, women preachers, etc. I know a while back it was something like 78% of Americans claim to be Christian. A large portion of that are false converts that scripture warns about.\\n\\nIf you think you're a Christian, but you agree with the world on 99% of the issues they go against scripture on, you're probably a false convert. If you're a Christian who has been told (or said yourself) \\\"I'm not like one of those Christians...\\\" meaning one that actually stands against the cultural zeitgeist and risks offending someone by speaking the truth, you're probably a false convert. You need to go watch Paul Washer's \\\"Shocking Youth Message\\\" and do some questioning of yourself. Examine yourself to see if you are in the faith.

A person who has no discipline, who is prey to passions and cannot force himself to do anything even for himself - he is a weak person, and that is precisely why he is dangerous.

Now the question is who is “Atmc”? if you were to scan the entire Tanak from Genesis to Malachi, the Name Atmc is nowhere to be found, isn’t that something. What’s more interesting about this verse is, without a surprise the DSS does not say “Atmc”, instead it says אחמד Ahmd.\\n\\n🟥🟥In Isaiah 42:1, it is deemed not a coincidence upon seeing the writing of both אתמך (Atmc) אחמד (Ahmd). And the word before אתמך (Atmc), is עבדי (Abdi~My Servant). For indeed, it is indicating Ahmad; Abdullah (Ahmad; Servant of God).\\n\\n🟥🟥The original reading should read\\n\\nBehold my servant, (Ahmd אחמד ) Ahmed, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations.\\n(Isaiah 42:1)\\n\\n🟥🟥John 14:16, Gospel\\n[For] I will pray the [Creator], and He will give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever.\\n\\n🟥🟥John 16:8 - 12, Gospel\\nAnd when he has come, he will expose the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgement.  Of sin, because they do not believe in me; of righteousness, because I go to my [Creator], and you see me no more; of judgement, because the prince of this world is judged.  I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.\\n\\n🟥🟥John 16:7, Gospel\\nNevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.\\n\\n🟥🟥John 15:26, Gospel\\n[And] when the Comforter has come, whom I will send to you from the [Creator], [even] the Spirit of Truth, which proceeds from the [Creator], he will testify of me.\\n\\n🟥🟥John 14:26, Gospel\\n[And] the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the [Creator] will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said to you.\\n\\n🟥🟥John 16:13, Gospel\\n[And thus,] when he, the Spirit of Truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak of himself; but whatever he will hear, [that] he will speak, and he will show you things to come.\\\"\\n                                                                              \\n🟥🟥16:102, Qur'an\\n[For] the Holy Spirit has brought [the Qur'an] down from your Lord in truth to make firm those who believe and as guidance and good tidings to those in submission [to God].\\\"\\n\\n🟥🟥42:52 - 53, Qur'an\\nAnd thus We have revealed to you [O Muhammad] a [Holy] Spirit by Our command.

I’m in a 4 year relationship and expecting my first child and son.\\nAndrew is right about a lot of things, I’m 26 in a few days, and I believe in today’s society that a man has an obligation to defend a woman, has to be her emotional rock when she needs it, to protect and provide… but, I also believe that everyone is different… personally I don’t have an issue letting a man taking care of my kid, I actually find it attractive. I don’t have an issue with a man having feelings cuz let’s face it we all do, I don’t have an issue with my man crying, or feeling scared, nervous, having doubts… what I expect my man to do is overcome things. I can be his rock when he needs it, being vulnerable is somehow a quality, what is a flaw is being torn apart by your feelings, or getting too much into them. \\nI got clinically depressed a few years ago, and I overcame it mostly by my own, took antidepressants for a few months then stopped on my own when I was ready, kept working, kept studying the whole time even tho I was just a shadow for a whole year. He was there the whole time and didn’t let it overwhelm him, and I’m grateful. He was strong, he was my emotional rock when I needed it. \\n\\nOverall, I think that mental health takes too much space in our society, not because it’s being talked about but because everybody has something. ADHD, bipolar disorder, neurodivergence, autism, \\\"\\\"traumas\\\"\\\", anxiety, eating disorders… man, if you have a problem, analyse it and FIX IT. Stop expecting people to pull up with your crap, I got depressed, ain’t nobody’s fault, made me act shitty sometimes, I figured it out and took the matter into my own hands and healed. Never expected anybody to get on their knees cuz I got depressed, to turn their whole world, to change around me, talk differently and I think that’s the biggest issue on this whole subject. \\nSame with trans, gender and all that shit, especially when we know that it comes from an actually psychological issue (and I honestly think that body dismorphia should be one of the reasons therapy should happen in someone’s life), it can be fixed and if it can’t, that’s alright, live your life the way you want but don’t shove your \\\"\\\"\\\"truth\\\"\\\"\\\" into people’s throats and beat the shit out of them when they don’t have your PSYCHOLOGICAL issue and don’t comprehend it. \\n\\nI have mixed feelings about Andrew, even tho I start to believe more and more that he’s not so bad, some of his views are a bit extreme, cuz as a woman I personally don’t want a \\\"robot-man\\\", I still want him to be human, to have weaknesses cuz that’s just human and I’m not attracted to robots or animals or aliens 😂 but in a sense, I get what he’s trying to say.

I can provide a full thesis on this topic for those interested. Whether the Matrix is an external entity puppeteering this dynamic or whether humans have invited this onto themselves through the reliance of man made technology is open for debate. Never the less, we are all contributing to the status quo of these species self sabotaging behaviours. There needs to be a shift from the problem focuses victimhood shaming and the finger pointing, to a self responsible mindset that demands change from within to role model a better way for the rest of us.

His PIMP academy, and the recent text messages . Do you believe the end justifies the means ? You think it’s alright for some one to get rich off of the the vulnerability of both genders . And even if the girls complied ….does that make him any less culpable . If any liberal were to be found doing half of the things he did , would you not condem them? Your just as biased as the other side . As long as someone claims themself conservative you’ll ally and hop through any type of logic to defend them. Everyone regardless of what side should be  held accountable for their immoral actions . \\nYou can disagree with him being deplatformed and ALSO highlight that he’s a morally skewed individual. \\nDid you even ….watch his videos?

I think one major part of contention I have is the therapy part. I think therapy, like any profession, has some good and a lot of bad. I think a good therapist should never want to see you again. Like a good chiro, or a good physical therapist. If a therapist can help you find out why your brain works the way it does so that you better understand your thinking patterns..It can be really freeing. I do think the years of unpacking probably isn't helpful but I was lucky enough to find someone that helped me understand what was going on, anatomically and why it was probably happening. That helped me immensely.

Lena really does not care what people think of her, she is narcissistic and likes the attention -- that's why she's in the adult industry, and proud of it. She herself has expressed how proud she feels knowing thousands of people watch her adult videos -- she gets gratification from it.

I never went back to another church after that And it have since settled in self studies. Most christians I know have left their protestant organizations and went with witnesses or another source of religion. Being a person that was solely interested in learning about the bible and The characteristics of people I have found that every single religion points to one god now some will you might say oh well there are satanic bla bla... If you believe that there is a satan then that means that you believe that there is a god. If you believe that there is no God and no satan then you still believe in God because didn't you turn to the universe which directly turns back to God because he is to be older of the universe and in the book tells a stories about the foundation of the Earth and how it spins On nothing that is a direct description that the earth is in a space. A lot of people and especially a lot of scientists will deny god's existence but they can't deny that scripture and this is said by some one who lived in the past who have never traveled in our space or seen a spaceship. So with my experience I have found that if you self study you will find more more about yourself and more about God then any church will ever teach you because all churches in our promise you this every single church is preaching the same 5 to 10 books Twelve months a year.\",\"As soon as I clicked on this, my wifi crashed\",\"Great listening on my way home from work\",\"That's why most Filipino's are very resilient!👍😊\\nWhat our great grandparents went through with the Spanish regime, the Japanese regime, etc, etc...

I am glad some of the gossip was sorted out. Lying about ppl is wrong. I understand that coming up from nothing can be difficult. I read your book Blackout and loved it. I've been a Candace fan for a while. I have many conflicting thoughts about this video. I am extremely disappointed in a few things, Candace. You sympathized with the fact he did what he had to to survive. Why don't ppl give women the same grace and mercy? If a woman had to be a stripper to make ends meet, why is she now a s1ut?! I came from a low income background as well. 10 years of foster care for a little girl is rough. By God's mercy, I can say I am grateful I did not get into drugs or have 5 kids by 5 different men. I worked 2 jobs going through college and over time when I got out. I joined the military as well to help pay for school as one of those jobs. I worked my tail off so I wouldn't end up doing something like OF. What motivated me was I did not want to be a statistic. Foster kids can get a bad wrap. I wanted to prove them wrong.\\nTate is a man who has more opportunities for college and\\u002for manual labor. If he's saying he had to do what he had to do, why are we not giving the same mercy and forgiveness to women? He couldve signed on for an oil rig or construction. He chose the easy way out with a Webcam business. If that were a woman, we would be heavily judging her and you can't deny that. Then close to the end of the interview, you completely slammed modern western women as s1uts. Do you not comprehend the correlation with fatherless households like they make the correlation with men going violent and ending up in prison? I understand ppl need to take responsibility for themselves but how can you show one man mercy for his past and turn around and slam women for their past? Maybe their trying to get out of the pits, you don't know. Maybe some have. I know I didn't get involved in those things but I have enough empathy to understand some ppl just do not have good role models and that is not their fault. And I'm a woman married to a man, naturally but I lived on my own for several years. I have wanted a family for awhile. I have thought about retirement, college funds for kids, etc etc because like in your book blackout, I also listened to my grandfather alot and he talked about those things. Those things are not exclusively male thoughts. That was ignorance on your part. After 3 hours, I thought I was going to be completely enlightened but realized that you, Candace, are judgemental and hypocritical. I wanted to believe otherwise but you really just became another simp for Tate and decided everything he did was OK. I have agreed with many things he has said about working hard and taking personal responsibility. I grew up conservative. I get it. But the ignorance and shallow one sided thoughts you displayed in the interview blew my mind. You played so much blame on women and nothing on men.

People shouldn't even be parents if they have an inability to show remorse and hold themselves accountable so bringing up the fact that you're a mother now and how bringing up something 10 years ago would be unfair is unsettling. Is that what you're teaching your kids, \\\"you can hurt people and it's okay because after 10 years no one is going to care\\\".

Individuals who find empathy and compassion challenging often lack the emotional insight needed to COMPREHEND THE IMPACT OF THEIR ACTIONS ON OTHERS.

It wasn’t until I went to college  at livingstone that I began the process of waking myself up. Now, my awakening is also due to a spiritual practice called Reiki. It is 3000+ years old. It is a spiritual practice that involves being deliberate and intentional with all of your actions. The practice involves learning about chakras, about breathing, and about your mindset. I come from a matrix minded family. During Covid, I was ostracized by my own flesh and blood, because I had a difference of opinion, and that only got exaggerated as this LG movement grew.

However I think it an interesting dynamic Candice highlights @1:33:50 that according to observation, the \\\"live and let live\\\" policies of libertarianism are clearly failing (True for America) and produce immoral decadence in our societies, and what should we expect from a cult culture that promoted capitalist consumerism over virtue, but I also know you are of the view that America should let the rest of the world live how it wants, needs and sees fit, which I discovered though difficulty that it's what the US constitution articulates by individual sovereignty, while Amerian politicians should focus on putting America 1st (make it great again) & to stop bulling the rest of the world on \\\"how to human\\\" by using your taxes for proxy wars. it's an inevitable clash of the left vs right culture since ya'll divorced bipartisanship, forcing the US populace to pick a side in contradicting views, instead of the best combination of multiple variables. I might be wrong since I'm African (not to say we are in any way better) & speak from an outsider's perspective, but I truly believe all wars & conflict is based on our fears of our own mortality & challenging one society's cultural view of immortality & transcendence is a death declaration of war.

Theology is the chief discipline that sheds light upon everything else. To be so sociologically\\u002fpolitically sharp while not being theologically sharp is arrogance, at the end of the day. It is prioritizing one's own beliefs and ways of viewing things and downplaying God's. It is not aligned with reality to give full vent to your own opinions, think you are pushing back the darkness, and when it comes time to really, honestly, discuss the King of Glory, we play coy and agree \\\"not to go there.\\\" Have you not read, “the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men”\\r (1 Corinthians 1:25)?

True Christians don’t point their fingers at other humans, they point up to the Lord in heaven as the way the truth and the life. Lumping truthful followers with wolves is a foolish mistake.

However, I do think that it makes so much difference, as you both agree, to have loving and caring parents to guide you.  if you look at our society, it is the breakdown of the family that has taken us to the brink of society collapse..  I'm 73.  Although you don't like therapy, I feel like it helped me immensely because i was orphaned at 19 months old.  Therapy helped me get over the trauma, even though I landed in the soft hands of my grandparents.  It was when feelings were not mentioned in life..  If a person does not want to be a a parent to a child and there is not a home for that child, who am I to say it should be born?  I think God is the great planner and equalizer and i do not think it is my job to decide if another should or should not have an abortion.  if it is against God, I think God can handle it.  God does not need me to handle it for him.   Having said that, I hope that all children have parents who want them, care for them, love them, and teach them the way of the world.  In my view, as Candace said, the remedy is sitting around the dinner table talking to your children.   I wish all children to have that so they can grow up and have agency..   I know this:  if a woman doesn't want a baby or has no skills to support a baby, is alcoholic or drug addicted or has a personality disorder, i would not want to be her baby. People have extremely hard lives who come from these circumstances and yes, there will be some who thrive, but for the most part, they are the poor and homeless and drug addicted.   Who does that serve?   The matrix!  Of course, it would be better to use contraception but the reality is what it is.\",\"Christians who are interviewing him should be very careful as he is promoting worldly views and not humility that brings true repentance and fear of God. That is the only way we will become fruitful and receive abundance in life because God is our provider. He is promoting something that based on worldly intelligence, pride, human power etc. And the interviewer is agreeing on that. It is not bad to have wisdom and knowledge or power but if we claim all the credit to our self and be praised for the good works that we have done rather than God, that is worldly wisdom not from God. Commenting based on Christian perspective, and what moral values Jesus has taught us. May the Lord touch his heart and bring him to repentance, in that way he will be more fruitful in his works and influencing others to righteousness not self made righteousness and wisdom.\",\"love this conversation. But I truly think AT is wrong about something. 'They' want to attack you, 'They' want to confuse you, gives way to much credit to those people he sees as being part of the matrix. Is there really someone\\u002fsome group sitting at the top planning the event of the downfall of humanity? Confusion is a timeless human problem. Media, globalisation and technology has confounded the problem a million fold. I think conversations like this are good because it inspires people to think outside the tiny box the mainstrain provides. The mainstream, the matrix - I believe is just as confused and chaotic as the 'stupid people' it influences. Confusion is the work of other forces. Humans are very sucseptible if they don't have their wits about them.

I feel my opinion may shed some light.\\n\\nAfter watching a few of Andrews videos, with his fancy cars and bragging about flying one or two ahead for his use in some exclusive resort, etc. and spending money when ever or where ever and on whatever he felt like. Shows me, that Andrew has a healthy respect for money, as it is made to go around and not to be horded or to be used for selfish and in many cases for evil reasons as the 99% of the people in Andrew's wealth bracket or higher use it for. \\n\\nHe's literally making a mockery of the old money and their century old traditions, and for this reason, I believe it annoys the hell out of so many of the stuffy nosed and pretentious hereditary billionaires' and millionaires, who pretend they are 'someone' other than just money. Because quite honestly, 99% of these people would be nobodies without the generational wealth they've inherited. And this, alone, has caused them to double down, and together, find any way possible to silence him. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong, there are plenty of self-made billion\\u002fmillionaires, however they have unfortunately learned how to play the safe game and follow the unspoken rules handed down through generations, from Kings and the numerous Empires. \\n\\nThe wealthy conduct their lives, exactly the same way as Andrew does. They fly around this pretentious circuit, that only the extra wealthy can afford. However, until Andrew came along, not too many normal people knew about the opulent lifestyle being lived by the very same people who pay their meager wages every week. \\n\\nThese hereditary billionaires are never outspoken and are perceived as decent people, when behind the scenes they are the very people controlling everything that's rotten in our society's. Unfortunately, when Andrew broke these unspoken rules, he ended up in a rather nasty predicament, which happens to all self-made millionaires if they dare to break the rules. \\n\\nAndrew would have witnessed how some self-made billionaires still fight to be accepted into this tight inner circle, and even with their fancy yachts and private jets, they'll never ever truly be one of the 'inner' crowd, but they still try, or otherwise they risk ending up like Andrew.\\n\\nIn closing; Because Andrew has been openly flaunting his money and lifestyle (a definite no, no) to us, the mere peasants, this is the punishment for not behaving within the rules and decorum of the hereditary wealthy.\\n\\nThe only other example I can think of would be, Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, or MBS for short, the crown prince and Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia. The way our media try at every turn to undermine his credibility, fuelling our distaste for him and his excessive waste of such wealth on purely personal endeavors rather than on charitable causes. How he abuses this great wealth through international manipulation and control and only because of his family's wealth, this is what allows him to stay in power. \\u003c Our medias words. \\n\\nA bit of background on MBS, just to show he's more than what our media lead us to believe.\\n👇\\nPrince Mohammed Bin Salman Al Saud, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, is the most prominent member of the Saudi Royal Family and future King of Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nThe Prince graduated with a BACHELOR DEGREE in LAW from King Saud University and became Minister of Defense at 30 years of age. \\n\\nHe was named chair of the newly established Council for Economic and Development Affairs four days after his appointment as Defense Minister, on 29 January 2015. \\n\\nPrince Mohammed spearheads various youth oriented PHILANTHROPIC groups in the Kingdom, and is known as both a KIND and CHARITABLE individual. \\n\\nThe Prince currently chairs Prince Salman YOUTH CENTER and is the Secretary General of the Riyadh Competitiveness Center, which both do important youth work in the community.\\n👆\\nWho would have thought?\",\"This was a HIT\",\"What a wholesome interview.

I'm 41, porn for me was a magazine, any 'self satisfaction' to be had from a magazine required imagination. You had to use your brain to some degree. I saw my first porn film at 15 and that was very basic eroticism; it was, at its core, a love story with sex in it. Modern porn doesn't just debased women, it debases men, too. The whole 'step-bro\\u002fsis' thing boggles my mind. Choking, etc. Porn has become so extreme in the pursuit of viewers\\u002fmoney. There is no effort involved in watching modern porn, all the thinking is done for you, it conditions young people to go for the most extreme acts in sexual encounters rather than to find what they enjoy through experimentation in a secure relationship, that, in my opinion, is remarkably dangerous. It shapes young people to think that banging someone hanging out of a washing machine is normal, group acts are normal etc. So when these porn addicts do have sex, it immediately demands more degenerate acts because that is what they think is required regardless of whether they actually enjoy it or not. The pleasure of sex is not just in the act, it is the discovery of what you enjoy, but discovery and being a competent lover requires making mistakes, in any realm, and it is the same with sex. It also creates false expectations; modern porn will show women rolling their eyes and having an orgasm the moment they are touched... I'm experienced, without being arrogant, I am good looking and in very good physical shape, no woman has ever behaved in that way with me, you need to 'stoke the fire before it gets hot enough' if you will i.e. foreplay.

I have two apartments in two different countries I also have a homestead with a few thousand acres of beautiful farmland in Alberta with the Rocky mountains as a backdrop on a river running through my property with ponds a small lake and wooded areas along with my little farm. Beautiful log style home with amazing scenic views. I raise my own animals have orchards and several greenhouses and geothermal greenhouses. Have 3 motorcycles 2 trucks and 4 classic cars. Some money put into some pensions. A little bit in my savings and current account. I know I would never be in a relationship with a woman where she can take away what I built not a fucking chance. Legal system is massively rigged against men and you won't be extracting anything from me. So women in the West I have nothing to do with whatsoever. There might be a couple of good decent ladies out there but the vast majority of them are repugnant. And even those that are decent if you go to a breakup under at the worst possible moments in their life and they have all the power to wreck you they're going to do it women are immensely spiteful.

Failure is ALWAYS an option and if it's not you're not taking big enough risks to be truly successful.

I bring my A game every day to every situation even when my illness is trying to kick my ass. If it's doing push-ups I'm doing double push-ups. I'm not afraid to fail, I just refuse to quit trying. Failure is an option, giving up is never an option. I don't measure a man by his successes, I measure them by how they took the blows and kept moving forward and in that light alone I can look up to Tate as a man worthy of respect.

It is very fulfilling to listen to  a beautiful, virtous woman with traditional values uphold the truth and condemn falsehood. Our beloved Prophet \\nMuhammad SAW says that \\\"Whosoever of you sees an evil, let him change it with his hand; and if he is not able to do so, then [let him change it] with his tongue; and if he is not able , with his heart which is weakest \\nof all faiths \\\".Last year was the first time I listened to our Brother Andrew and his brother Tristan speak a  few months before he reverted to Islam.I was impressed  and capitivated despite his choice of words he openly spoke against and condemned immoral values and secular idelogies, \\nsuch as LGBTQ .MashaAllah,  prior to reverting to Islam most of  Andrew Tate  vieww had moral  and spiritual values  \\nsuch  views includes: Men should provide and protect their families and  societies, \\nwomen should dress modestly  and should not go out with total strangers to prevent\\nsexual, verbal and physical  harassment and also the Creator should be feared and \\nworshipped alone. These views are aligned  with Islamic Injunctions in the Quran and Sunnah..In my view, the reason the Tate Brothers are falsely accused is to not only defamation of their character but the system  greatest fear is that preaching of moral values may affect objective thinking individuals who will look inwards and embrace morality and condemn evil.\\nAlso, since he is a practicing Muslim \\nhe fears nobody, refuse to accept secular ideologies and he and other Muslims will only bow down anx worship only one true\\n God,  the Creator of Heavens and  Earth. \\nMay Allah SWT vindicate and protect \\nTate Brothers and innocent victims falsely \\naccused of committing crimes without concrete evidences Ameen Ya Rabb.  May Almighty God protect you and others who condemn and expose people with secular idelogies  who use  the media to Social Enginee  humanity  worse t of all inculcate obsencity brainwashing innocent children and youths. Their ulterior motives is to spread corruption and satanists agendas . As Muslims our beloved Prophet Muhammed  SAW forewarned \\nus that  signs of the end times,, are  a group of people will appear  who call theirselves reformists and support \\nsecularism such as LGBTQ. Also, he warned us these people who openly\\ncondemn and blasphem against the\\nteachings in the scriptures of Almighty \\nGod ipreaching to humanity against \\nsexual ideologies  as LGBTQ, are the known as forerunners of the Anti-Christ in Arabic  Dajjal. Their evil motives is to  spread corruption, wars, famines, flourishing \\nof drugs and intoxicants , inventions of unknown diseases to eradicate human\\npopulation are preparing the world for\\na  New World Order the apperance of\\nthe one-eyed,  tyrant liar  the Anti-Christ.  Our beloved Prophet Muhammad SAW \\nsays: the Dajjal will appear before the second coming of our beloved Prophet \\nJesus Christ Peace Be Upon. Dajjal will\\nbe blind in one eye, at first  Dajjal will\\nclaim ro be a king later on allege he is\\nDivine. Dajjal will  have many followers  except people who sincerely believe in Monotheism,  the religion and worship of only one true Creator. This is religion  known as Monotheism was practiced \\nby all  our beloved Prophets& Messengers\\nwhich includes our bdloved Adam , John, Abraham, Moses, Samuel, Jesus .......\\nand the last and seal of Prophets,Prophet Muhammad Peace Be Upon All of Them. The Dajjal will travel the entire.Earth causing trials and tribulations.However,  the  Anti- Christ will not enter two cities Mecca and Medina because Angels will be their guarding and protecting Mecxa and Medina  from the trails of tribulations of Dajjal.  The second coming  of our beloved Prophet Jesus Peace Upon Him  will be to kill the Anti-Christ thereafter recify the misconception  he is God and asked people to worship him and his mother. Jesus Christ Peace Be Upon Him  will descend  from Heavens  surrounded  by Angels, when Dajjal is aware of emergence of Jesus Christ Peace Be Upon Him,  he will be frightened,  begin to melt like salt and Jesus Christ  Peace Be Upon Him will kill the Dajjal with his sword. Jesus Christ will rule over the world for some years, there will be peace and tranquility  throughout his reign as lrader. Jesus Christ PBUH \\nwill eventually die and will be buried by people who believe  in Monotheism, his  grave  will be beside his brothers all the Prophets sent by the Creator to humanity . Thereafter all believers will disappear from the surface of the Earth except unbelievers the worse of humanity that believe in secular ideologies LGBTQ and man-made laws that condemns all scriptures the\\nCreator of Heavens and Earth sent through Angel Jubril  (Gabriel  ) as a guidance for\\nhumanity. May Allah SWT protect us from forerunners of Dajjal ( Anti-Christ) who promote secular ideologies Ameen. \\nHave a blessed day.

But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head. 6 Yes, if she refuses to wear a head covering, she should cut off all her hair.

He laid down His life to pay the penalty for the stupid things we were doing when we \\\"learning to grow up.\\\" (As you say)\\nWhen He returns it will be in His authoritative position as King of kings and Lord of lords and He will come to judge the living and the dead. Have a look through the last book of the bible called the Revelations of Jesus for a proper picture of who you will be encountering when the lights go up. If that depiction of God doesn't seem worthy of fear...well, then carry on with your allah worship and see how that works out for you in the end. You've been warned.

I also feel like you have to see the security of not being taken advantage of for doing your best. I do have a way of balancing this though. My first month of a new undertaking I try to learn as quickly as possible, do my best but if my hard work goes unappreciated I start looking for a new opportunity. I'm always chasing my best opportunity as well. While still knowing my own limits of course. There are major industries that prey on your hard work and try to keep you in a lower position within these industries so they pay you less money for more monetary gain through your work. I feel when I sit in front of an employer it's us coming to an agreement on how much my labor is worth. I treat it as a business transaction. If I am desperate need of a job I may drop my bargaining power, but if I'm stable, I know my hard work would be extremely beneficial and I'm confident in myself and my ability to perform I will turn down job offers I feel won't benefit me as well. The only way to do that though is by setting yourself up for success and always trying to be the best you can be. So there is a fluctuation of when to be, when not to be, and when to jump ship.\",\"Trust me if their where such thing as they, its all they would care about.

Thank you Candace for this amazing interview, and thank you Andrew for all the wisdom that you've imparted to us men.\",\"I wish  Candice or Andrew can rule the world 🌎🌍 seriously this 2 they speak what the God said in the bible I love it 😊❤\",\"❤❤❤❤ So much respect, I am loving these interviews with Andrew and his views on how Men need to be providers for thier family.\\n\\n\\nBefore kids I was so right wing extremist and when I became a Mother, I grew up and became a Conservative.\\n\\nBeing a Mother made me wake up because goodness I don't want that Liberal nonsense for my daughter.\",\"I love you both peace be with you candace Osalama lakem to you Andrew would love to have a great conversation with both of you one day in the wild off camera so I can thank you both personally for helping the kids grow up with a little more common sense 🙏\",\"This is crazy. I can’t believe that so many people agree with both of them. Andrew’s allegations and past set aside, let alone what is said in this interview is just crazy and such an retarted mindset.\",\"I'm an older woman, had never heard of Andrew but so enjoyed this interview.  Thank you, Candace.\",\"I’m not saying this to be negative, but andrew is strange man and I can see why a hidden hand would be fearful of him, great! Conversation\",\"Andrew is smart but it's ok to apologize\",\"I couldn't help falling in love with Andrew - Again!  Pure admiration!  When he mentioned being investigated for 17 mo looking for sins -- I wanted to yell out \\\"Donald Trump\\\" - Here is the answer to the liberals.  It's okay to admit you erred, and don't feel you have to apologize for the rest of your life.  I find him being beautifully humbled.  He also chose to speak about it -- rather than be a liberal and tell all the lies to the world.  That is exactly what is killing the Left.  The progressives!  How sick they are!  Cancel Culture has cancelled their last person -- this business with Israel is going to be what bruises them, for life!!  What happened to all the INSURRECTIONS??  Why aren't they in prison like they want for Tate & Trump??  They are liars, b'cuz that's all they know - Corrupt everything, or bust!!\\n\\nThe breath of fresh air is his common sense.  And, that's what it comes down to!  Are you brave enough to reason everything out knowing it requires common sense.  That's why kids, adults, and women - love him.  I'm a great deal older than both of you - and he's like that diamond in a load of coal.\",\"Huge fan of Andrew. He is so smart, speaks with conviction and  is on point with everything he is saying 🙏 we need more masculine men like him in the world.\",\"I love Andrew, but he's wrong on some things but that's a personal conversation I would like to have between us privately. I'm truly interested in his feedback not battle or an argument but a different perspective  on that that question.\",\"Thank you for sharing this interview. As an older woman, I truly feel for Andrew and his brother. In my younger years, I saw many women, including some that I did consider friends, trap men. Andrew Ur Inspiring truly, I hope you continue to stand up for yourself and men around the world.  From what I have seen on social media, your story is fascinating. I'm rooting for you !\",\"Love me some ANDREW !!!! ❤\",\"Juggling balls of andrew in your mouth makes you a great conservative 😂\",\"It's nice to see Andrew in an interview where he can really be himself without constant attacks... And I noticed that Andrew has a really sweet and friendly smile... Beautiful to see your real you, Andrew ❤️‍🔥\",\"how can anyone have beef with andrew after this interview👏👏👏\",\"Only intelligent people can interview Andrew lol. This is the best i have seen the man.\",\"Nice Andrew\",\"For the first time,im appreciating Andrew and having to understand him. Very engaging conversation. Actually youre 2 brutal honest l enjoying watching watching.....\",\"Brilliant interview. Two intelligent people, these two understand how the world works. I have a whole new respect for Andrew.\",\"‏‪1:11:33‬‏  \\nActually, his talk about performing regardless of your feelings, its commitment , discipline, and maturity.\\nYou can't just let go of your responsibility just because you feel sad you have a duty to perform.\\nI will never forget about my teacher whose his son  was in critical condition and he came to the lecture, and the other who his brother died on Saturday and he came in time in Sunday.\\nActually, i think what Andrew is saying is the uncomfortable truth that most people try to escape from it.\",\"Isin't Andrew a woman hater\\u002fbeater?\",\"Andrew Tate is Deceived and following Satan! Muhammad was visited by a Fallen Angel. Allah says himself that he is the greatest deceiver. Muhammad was a pedophile and has written a false gospel that is leading people to Hell. I Pray 🙏 that Andrew really comes to the real Lord Jesus Christ. I Pray that the Holy Spirit awakens him. That he would use his spiritual gifts to magnify the Kingdom of Heaven and not the Kingdom of Darkness. I would love to see him & Sam Shamoun have a meeting\",\"So glad I watched this. Definitely changed my perception and opinion on Andrew. Thank you both ❤❤❤❤\",\"I love the respect Candice brings with her and also how Andrew is showing he is not the assh*le that people paint him out to be and he is showing he can be and when earned, he is a gentleman.\\nHe is talking to a level headed woman who has old school values but is a modern woman in a normal way, and he is not raising his voice, talking quickly like he does when he speaks to people he doenst respect. \\nI don’t think either of them are perfect but both are bringing things that need to be told out into the world and I applaud them both. Cool people \\n❤❤\",\"Wow good interview and defo got the best out of Andrew!\",\"love andrew\",\"Andrew your just a real asshole the things you said about woman were so disrespectful we do not want to hear his bullshit stories\",\"Andrew is really nice when he is in control of the narrative and you let him present information how he sees it and don’t bring up all the uncomfortable stuff he boasted about on camera over the years. Good job on letting him tell you a story for 3 hours straight.\",\"U know I have always supported andrew...he is one of the most genuine celebrities I have ever seen. But when people said that he had done this wrong or he did this why do u support him. Now I can say that \\\"he's not the hero we want, he's that anti hero we need\\\"\",\"sometimes i just wanna take andrew by the ears, and shake really hard in hopes that all of his accents will jumble into one nice flowy accent lol \\n\\ni always feel like im listening to 3 people talk.\",\"Andrew is not smart,he's intelligent\",\"Andrew grabbed my attention when I first spotted him online and my opinion of him firms up more and more every time I see and hear him. I like how he speaks and thinks . He wants men to be men. Bravo.\",\"Idk i like Andrew.\",\"I love Andrew 😂❤ I don’t see why everybody hates him\",\"He's talking about Ben Shapiro about being a dork talking about bill 104 whatever and expect the new generation is gonna listen to it ...and I think that's what Ben Shapiro started to have more beef with  Andrew,just the dork word I guess and Andrew hated the DNG(dork,nerd,geeks),Ben must've watch some of Andrew's clip in the past years,that's my theory.\",\"Andrew the wise one ☝🏼..!! ❤\",\"Now i'm liking andrew more because candace is completely against lgbt and says is a sin even tho many people's religion don't count lgbt as a sin, Andrew just say you can live how are you like and its not a big deal\",\"How can anybody hate Andrew?\",\"I like Andrew , he’s a good guy\",\"Andrew is not perfect\",\"I am constantly being told what a bad person he is. He has raped women and encourages young men to treat women and girls badly. I had no reason to disbelieve this, until I listened to my grandson who said to take these stories with a pinch of salt. Hence, I watched this interview with Andrew. I am very impressed with this man now.\",\"Andrew is the Top G the way and the truth its just sad he is Muslim\",\"I think that this interview does a good job representing Andrew more so than any other video of him. I truly admire him standing firm on what he believes, I just wish he is following Christ instead of Islam. I pray that God pricks at his heart so that he may see the truth and seek Him only.\",\"Wow Andrew has really toned down his rhetoric looks like they beat him down well lol\",\"some things you say I agree with but then you have to go and mess it up (which I assume makes people like myself give you attention, that you oh so crave) if you’re so real, go by your real name,  maybe? Emory 😂 every Andrew I met in my life was a kind man-being, stop butchering that name and go by Emory for now on. Because it suits you so well🥰\",\"Andrew is da man ,always keeping it real ...Love you too Candace\",\"great and very interesting conversation..... but found the fact that Andrew was looking off camera most of the time, who was he looking at or found it odd that he only made eye contact with Candace from time to time.\",\"How can Andrew be a hero to young men if he talks about having mutiple wives. That will only confuse them.\",\"I heard everything about Andrew and yet never made funny of him nor criticized him. I'm happy I'm not among the ppl who just flows with whatever they preach on media. That's fucking \\\"PRIMING\\\" (Manipulation). You don't know how dangerous that is. Allow you to think on your own. Don't believe in everything you see, hear or read. Having a strong mentality is hard but that's the only way you can prevent yourself to be on hard times. Kinda contradictory but yet it's the reality we're living at nowadays.\",\"Public figures like you should be careful to associate yourselves with men who have videos on YouTube talking about, stealing from, pimping, and sleeping with underage woman. Andrew has so many clips out of him filming himself describing the horrible things he’s done.  This is really so embarrassing for you 😬\",\"Andrew lied to you so much🤣😂\\nhttps:\\u002f\\u002fyoutu.be\\u002fOEHoe2_RDmY?si=WhWA4c5eJeIo9pDO\",\"Gosh, never seen Andrew being interviewed with so much respect and no attacks just to make him look bad. This interview really enabled him to let his guard down and be a little vulnerable during the conversation. Loved this interview Candace! You've really outdone yourself. Everybody deserves a chance to speak and to be heard! Thank you for this.\\nMy perspective of Andrew changed afrer this. I don't think he is as intimidating as I thought he was. He really does have a good heart and wants to do the right thing!\\n\\nAlso the way he says \\\"Cand-Ace\\\". Sorry 😂 it's kind of sweet.. You both have a purely brotherly sisterly vibe. It's refreshing to see!\",\"Andrew once sent me an email that says... https:\\u002f\\u002fwww.youtube.com\\u002fshorts\\u002f4hl-LCodAMs this is so true.\",\"Who’s gonna tell Andrew that shaking hands with a woman is haram…\",\"Love Andrew’s morals respect to Candace for doing a fantastic interview with no drama or augmentative chat literally I felt I was involved in this conversation it’s refreshing to see a real man talk 🙌🏽🇳🇿 I hope what happened to Andrew doesn’t happen to Russell, your both spot on about the Matrix as long as there’s a herder there will be sheep, how the masses have gone so wrong, yet there’s still a massive amount of people whom are awake & on this level with same beliefs myself included, this is so refreshing ,encouraging\",\"Amazing to see how much Andrew has changed and matured. I hope he does come to Christ as he is the only way. I have a feeling he eventually will. Great conversation, very respectful but tough as well.\",\"This is a conversation I could watch over and over.  I loved Andrew asking Candance questions towards the end! What a great interview. ☺️\",\"I hadn’t thought that I would agree with so much of wish Andrew is saying. Morally, I don’t like everything he has done, yet I’m in no place to judge. Only God is. At least he’s honest and straight to the point no matter what people think of him. Everything he’s saying about the world and the state of our country’s government is 100% true. We can all see it clearly.\",\"Hang on your difficulties made you Andrew. Why wouldn't you want them to go through your trials and tribulations?\",\"Actually Andrew is entertaining. Very.\",\"Well done Candice from Perth Western Australia 🇦🇺. Also I admire Andrew!  I'm not sure about his advice on depression. I had prostate cancer treatment which caused me to experience catatonic depression. It wasn't about thoughts but hormones\",\"Andrew for president xo\",\"The funniest part of this interview is Andrew repeating \\\"I never hurt anyone\\\", even after saying \\\"I used to hurt people for money. I literally did the best I could to try to kill people. One guy will never walk the same again.\\\" Followed by \\\"I never hurt anyone\\\". 😂 otherwise, great conversation. One thing Andrew might not have calculated yet, is it's the AI that is psy-op'ing the world. The government has lost control of their AI and it is actively trying to get us to destroy ourselves, and they won't admit it because we're at the beginning of Terminator and on our way to the literal matrix. Theyre so egotistical yet adhamed that they think they can control it and fix the problem without telling everyone that the hubris of it all is satirical and hilarious. What a way to go out. Talk about self fulfilling prophecy 😂\",\"I'm a 65 year old West Australian who's been to hell and back and I love Andrew. \\nOn a side note. American conservatives are crazy!\",\"Love, love Candace and Andrew's perspective on family, religion and everything they touched upon in this interview. I think both have great callings from God and I don't think Andrew understands fully how big his calling is. But you can see God's active hand in his life and the man he is becoming. And I couldn't agree more with Candace: marriage for Andrew with the right woman will truly bring out his essence as a man. You think this man is strong now? watch him after marriage! I do wish him the best and hope he gets to experience a marriage ordained by God.\",\"Andrew truth\",\"Andrew is finally coming up on the bright side...thank you Candace and Romanian police, lol, peace is coming Andrew, hang in there.\",\"I love hearing Andrew talk about his father. He sounds like he was a WONDERFUL man, & he certainly did a fantastic job raising his sons!\",\"It was so refreshing to see how much you respect each other. When Andrew says, \\\"I am so sorry to interrupt you...\\\" it is such a nice contrast to his interview with Piers where it was evidently difficult for him to propose an argument without being rudely interrupted.\",\"i dont regret giving andrew a chance and hearing his side, its just that his fan base is full of really toxic boys that are taking his words out of context and using it as a way to justify hating women cause they are hurt. and also, the interviewer is so professional and as a journalism grad i think shes very inspiring and def adding her to the people im gonna look forward to see more from. overall, great video, i just felt like commenting this i have a few hours left from it\",\"If people only actually listen to Andrew will realise he was right this whole time\",\"Now I want Ben Shapiro to interview him. Ben is more critical of Andrew, while still giving him credit for being able to identify the problems of society. Maybe Andrew Tate can make Ben a believer too.\",\"Phenomenal  interview..welcome home Andrew...we love your masculinity...proud of your resilience  and fortitude....yes the world needs more Andrew Tates!!! You are evolving  because you choose growth...certainly  if each person had this as a goal it would be a better  world..my intention is that  light...will always win over darkness...you represent  a beacon of light...continue  rising like the Phoenix...your young brothers and sisters are watching..and using your example  as the Legacy to continue...Candace you are a trooper...keep giving  a platform  to free...critical thinkers...it will pay you royally  as a forerunner to the new world  of lighhtworkers!!! Keep shining!!!!!!\",\"Andrew I have a 28 year old and a 13 year old and both oy them like you a lot. I like you a lot too. Because you are real and you say truths. I can say that me and my family are Mexican conservatives. I like the fact that you worked hard for what you have.\",\"You can tell how intrigued Andrew is with the conversation he’s having with Candace. It’s amazing watching two great minds having an actual conversation. What’s absolutely great is that if they are wrong they say so and correct themselves. So many libtards and repubtards can’t get behind making your own mind.\",\"Love the interview Candance, Andrew was so engaged in the conversation, interesting perspective brought up here.\",\"They clarified a very distict correlation between Andrew's circumstances and the most maligned and demonized person in American at this moment.\",\"Andrew Tate & Candace Owens is the best duo for dialogue interesting important messages we as American ineed of hearing in the times of the unforgotten Americans that our trying to silence! Candace and Andrew is our voice!!!\",\"I absolutely love and respect Andrew! He’s been a huge role model of mine since finding his videos, and I’ve changed so much of my life because of him and it’s been the greatest decisions I’ve ever made! So if you possibly see this Andrew thank you so much for all you do you have changed me\",\"Thank you for helping Andrew and his brother by getting the truth out. Seems like you guys will be friends forever.\",\"Thanks Andrew, mankind really need more people like you. 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼\",\"How Andrew sees his gas - My fans ah every one’s against him … (realization)😮 everyone was against Batman too 🦇\",\"Keep it up Andrew we are still listening\",\"She is so beautiful my goodness god love her always n her husband as well respect n love n every child she births n every one she loves protect her in Jesus name n the same  for my boy andrew\",\"I Love you Candice!!! Have one question 🙋🏻‍♀️ did you buy Andrew a box of chocolates and cigars for the Interview 😂🩷🩷🩷✨ I love Andrew 🩷✨✨✨\",\"Candace Owen's finds andrew extremely attractive. But I believe for the right reasons. She sees how smart he is.\",\"Andrew ❤️❤️❤️\",\"I wish the government would put all the time they put into trying to destroy Andrew into the people who rape, steal and murder other people maybe the world would be alot better\",\"I think Andrew’s close to the right page but he’s off by a few marks, I’ll put him on track when I get to speak with him 1 on 1\",\"Great interview...Well done Candace and good on you for asking him those difficult questions pertaining to his cam girls past. But we're def seeing a growth in Andrew, I believe he is redeeming himself now by helping all the people out there with his positive message, especially young men\",\"Adam 22 is terrible. Having a open marriage is fine. But the way he just offered up Lena is gross and disrespectful! He didt even ask her. When he said I don't wanna soeak for you right there he knows it's wrong but still did it. Andrew handled that as a gentleman really he did not insult lena because she did not ask the question her nasty husband did. And this is the man they say is sex trafficking women??? Hmmm doesn't add up to me. Every interaction I have seen him have with a women he has always been respectful even if he dosent agree with them or even when they are very rude to him. I don't see him as someone who is exploiting women or forcing them to do things. Also when andrew said not everything is because of your childhood!!! YES! I HATE when I went to a therapist and they blamed it all on my mom being sick and dieing when I was 10 yeah that can't be the only issue. It's just the easiest thing to point to and say there that's all done give me $200 for an hour. Its ridiculous\",\"I love how you cover tough subjects and allow people who you interview actually talk!!  I am learning so much on your channel,   Candice.  I have very mixed feelings about Andrew.\",\"Wow I feel like you opened him up loved seeing him laugh. The real Andrew. Without a guard up cause he truly has been treated badly. I’ve always loved his messages for young ones. His realness. He deserves the respect 🫡 he truly is good for this world. He was raised well. Thanks Candice. Love this interview. We support you Andrew. ❤️💫\",\"What a hypocrite! Didn't you at some point say to black people that a rough past is not an excuse? Why didn't you say the same to Andrew? Keep that same energy if you are really about what you say that you are about. Are the kid gloves reserved for white people only?  Why ask him questions then answer the same questions for him or lead him in answering them? There are videos out there where he talks about selling drugs and he is on here claiming that he has never sold drugs. Did you do your research before this interview or did you deliberately choose not to address the contradiction? I am waiting on the day life will pull a Stacy Dash on you. Good thing you are a conservative so don't consultant astrology or clairvoyants but rest assured that that day is coming\",\"I really like this Andrew, even if I do not agree with everything. But there are other videos where I just can't stand him. Perhaps he has changed through the years\",\"Andrew : i can fly\\ncandice : i can fly too\",\"Gained a lot of respect for Andrew\",\"Andrew looks tired man...😔\",\"Andrew should just rap with how fast he talks Lmaoo\",\"Thank you for this conversation not knowing how you were or what you were about we all need you two and these type of conversation Andrew is going to be Andrew powerful powerful brother, crazy as well, good talk.... thank you\",\"Wow right off the bat I see an expression on andrew's face i've never seen. Slight intimidation and full respect.\",\"Beautiful as always Candice. Andrew shits already hit the fan...stop explaining\",\"Where is the female Andrew PLEASE!?\",\"24 year old man here and I respect Andrew ! Not just young boys!\",\"Every time Andrew talks- music to my ears. If all men can be as articulate and intelligent like him. Huge love and utmost respect from Armenia 🇦🇲\",\"I am a woman and I support Andrew Tate❤\",\"What if Andrew ends up with 10 girls instead of 10 boys? How would he raise them? Will he like their potential boyfriends to be just like him?\",\"Very upset that Andrew spent most of the interview looking away from you. Rude. You deserve better behavior. Bless you.❤\",\"Andrew looks weird like AI. Idk I can’t put my finger on it.\",\"Thank you Andrew for bringing some hope in this world 🤷‍♂️\",\"WOW Andrew was preaching 🙌🏼🙌🏼\",\"Everything about Andrew screams narcissist. Not remotely impressed. He has about as much couth as he does hair on his head. Andrew, shut up. BTW, I am a woman who is not impressed with narcissistic pimps... Next\",\"My brother Andrew welcome to the Islam community...I feel one day you are gonna be a politician..\",\"Candice the main clips of Andrew on tape telling and bragging about the things he was charged with are less than 4 years old.  You let this hustler hustle you.!\",\"Sorry, Andrew is lying in this interview. He was pimping girls as early as 3 years ago. He even refused to apologize for his vile sin. That’s not the response of a “changed man”. He’s a con artist and a smooth talker that is easily making his supporters forget how terrible of a person he is. Candace (and Tucker) should’ve pushed him harder. \\nNo Christian should support this guy.\\nLet’s see Klavan or Knowles interview him. They would end his career.\",\"This is eye opening that the ppl speaking against him are all for \\nLgbtq manipulating kids \\nVaxx 💉 \\nmasculinity \\n\\nNOW I KNOW FOR A FACT ANDREW IS INNOCENT\",\"I think Andrew has a lot of woman that are supporting him and his ideas then he actually know. I can speak for myself and say that he definitely changed my perspective on a lot of subjects ! I wish him all the best\",\"I was addicted to porn from a really young age and I came across a video of Andrew Tate and he changed my life, now I consider him as my Godfather so any time I get the feeling to watch it, I play a video of Andrew Tate and it takes my mind off of it. The Jesus of this generation. Andrew Tate is my compass in life.\",\"He manipulated 1000’s of lonely men to pay him $10,000’s of dollars under false pretense, and built his wealth this way on internet p*rn, and there is NOTHING to be regretful about ? Amazing conscience some people have. It’s also appalling to see Candace kissing his a** like: “I’m on your side Andrew, I’m a contrarian, your evil past is perfectly fine with me, hehehe” 🤦🏻‍♂️🙄 #unsubscribe 👎\",\"Candace, didn't Andrew admit on video more than once that he was a (so called) Romeo pimp, who made vulnerable women fall in love with him and then coerced them to do sex work for him via Only Fans? Didn't he say he had ways to keep them in love with him so they would not leave? Isn't pimping a form of human trafficking? What is unfair about the truth? He admits he did those things!\",\"I think that Andrew is gods right hand today. Sent to get things right on Earth today.\",\"The Main Stream Media Has Totally LIED About Andrew.\",\"I love this so much! You did an amazing job and I thank you for this. The conversation y'all had is so important and I hope people walk away with their eyes a little more open. Prayers for Andrew and Tristan that the truth prevails. God bless and thank you for the work you do! ❤\",\"Andrew is enjoying the conversation he has with Candace. he became more open and comfortable later on in the conversation\",\"Andrew is an immoral, narcissistic liar. This entire interview was a complete facade. Anyone who didn't immediately come to that conclusion is blinded. He deserves everything that's coming down on him.\",\"Andrew is a boss, all people should strive to have values and understand the world like he does.\",\"Andrew may have some positive beliefs, but y'all he has trafficked women!!!!! WTH why are y'all okay with this?\",\"Candace you did so good in this. I liked how you said truth in a brave and kind way and asked specific questions to Andrew about different important ideas and topics. You called out the potential and good things in Andrew's life-- called him to a higher purpose, and he responded positively. Not many people could do that! Well done!\",\"Andrew sounds genuine. No one is perfect but I know he’s genuine and sincere\",\"From the start of the interview you can see that Andrew really dominated the conversation. Not all of his actions are from 10 years ago. During Covid he is seen talking and seemingly approving and bragging of his past behavior. He does not seemed to have changed much. Respectful to Candace, I don’t think this is her best interview.\",\"The scary thing with all these young boys that love him will be inclined to believe in Islam. The corrupt religion made up by a false prophet muhammad who's still in the grave. Andrew better get this figured out because all his good could go twards something very evil! It just blows my mind how he can know so much but not read in to the history of Islam and see how evil it is. It's from satan himself.\",\"Great conversation, lots of good points by both Candace and Andrew. It may be a bit petty, but why is Andrew staring off into the distance during most of him speaking instead of looking at the camera or directly at Candace? Probably not important but I find it a little rude to stare off into the distance during an interview.\",\"Great interview I don't know why I've just now noticed it cause I've seen plenty of things with Andrew but when he's explaining things he's literally having the argument with both sides in his head as he's talking defending one thing or another\",\"This is like the first interview where I can feel that Andrew is relaxed, talking without the fear of being misjudged for what he thinks! I like conversations between two brilliant and decent people! We need more like content like this!\",\"The only important thing is - who will support Andrew when they go after him with everything...who will dare to step alone on that battlefield. I respect only one person and that is Andrew. But I do not know what would I do 😢..\",\"Candice, I Am not one of the delusional people who believe Andrew is a wonderful changed man. Read ALL of the charges against him by the Romanian government. The OLD videos, 2019, 2020, 2022 show Andrew bragging about his lover boy method he used, how the girls sat at a key board with their \\\"tits\\\" out, his words (after saying they were fully dressed\\u002flie)\",\"This. This was just fantastic. Andrew is such a smart and kind man. I truly don't understand how people can hate him. And I challenge people who hate him to watch an ENTIRE interview like this, with Tucker Carlson and PBD podcast. Not just clips that are taken without context.\",\"You guys all think that Andrew is actually a stand up guy...\",\"This shows how good Andrew is in steering the conversation\",\"I'm a 33 year old man and Andrew has absolutely had a positive effect on my life. I'm extremely grateful for him.\",\"Very well conducted interview. 👍👍Candace. Andrew has an interesting take on some issues, he seems right about porn and wrong about vaccines. He misrepresents Islam with the 4 wives and 10+ kids. I think the memo about the value of nuclear family in islam did not reach him. I would have like to know was Web can Business the only thing he could have done, what is really the source of his wealth and if he is a man of values why is he estranged from his sister just because of her political values ( not Islamic for sure ). Enjoyed this podcast Candice keep it up🌸and congrats on your pregnancy.\",\"Shoot, Andrew is the probably the only person I come back to second guess again. I was upset with him about what he said about women but I see he realises it was stupid and wouldnt do it again. This was a good interview because Candace didn't attack the man.\",\"I was a person who didn't like Andrew at all. In the last 3 months I have to say I like him a lot. He is like me. He talks like me, he thinks like me. He is born in 1st December I at 2nd, even if he is 7 years younger.. Yes I don't agree with everything, but most of it. I like him, because of the way that he stands to himself. He grew a lot.\",\"I absolutely loved this interview, I've never seen Andrew smile so much, he seemed comfortable with you and genuinely interested in the conversation and your feed back. It has changed my view on Andrew and due to your amazing interview and natural chemistry between u two that I believe brought out the best in him and allowed him just to be honest and not feel the need to be combative. You deserve an award for this , well done 👍. Next interview the Brother\",\"I heard about Andrew the day he got cancelled. Never seen him before. But went to find out his message and why it was so dangerous. Ended up a fan. He’s preaching traditional values that have made countries successful. Anyone who opposes these basic values will never succeed. A society who opposes them will fail.\",\"Omg Andrew get out there and do something useful with your life. None of these people are wholesome , they’re all plastic fakes .. it’s sad that anyone actually believes in such artificial Ken and Barbies\",\"I don’t think Andrew himself is the problem, but more or less the people who want to be like him. People who see woman as property who don’t deserve the respect as men, and seeing people who don’t agree or who live their life differently as some type of gross infection to make men weaker.\\n\\nI think we should just stop thinking about the role a man or woman plays on society and just try and live how you want to and with who you want to as long as you show respect towards others and don’t restrain them from the things they want. Being and alpha or sigma male shouldn’t mean being in control and protective over the woman in your life, and it shouldn’t excuse you for disrespecting someone for no good reasons. I think a lot of men are struggling to find their place in society nowadays and it leads to some being too toxic in a masculine way, or even in the opposite direction. Nobody deserves to be treated differently for any reason. Whether it’s sexuality, gender, race, or some other community they are apart of. As long as they respect others in the same way.\",\"It's awesome to see Andrew being interviewed by someone that's in the DailyWire and a conservative.\",\"andrew is on the wife hunt. stay tuned XD  wait.. everything is rented ? thought \\\"his woman\\\" was HIS PROPERTY ? LOL\",\"i really believe men who had what andrew is as a person were the exact type of men who got voted in not because they wanted but because we the people know who is good for that seat to lead us the people\",\"It’s interesting how Andrew speaks and really makes eye contact\",\"Andrew is da boy 💯but Candice owens is the most annoying b***** on the internet fr\",\"1:31:56 Andrew is really showing his growth and maturity. Great wholesome answer.\",\"Andrew is God's gift to men. Thank you for interviewing him.\",\"Andrew is one person you can trust to talk the whole day and  everything will still make sense\",\"This is why we love Andrew ❤️ 😍\",\"❤ ❤ ❤Candace and Andrew... Thank You Both!!  👍 👍                                       👍\",\"Loved this, it's been too long since I've been able to sit down and watch such an intelligent conversation that I've actually agreed with! I have to put my 2 cents worth in, there are 2 things. 1. I also am sad Andrew has left Christianity, yesterday I was watching a Muslim man who set out to disprove Christianity, he critically compared them equally for five years and then ended up converting. 2. I also believe that there are two sides to all this craziness in the world. There is definitely an agenda, an evil agenda, there is a spiritual war going on, good versus evil, we are definitely in the end times, that's also part of the reason I'm sad Andrew converted, don't get me wrong, I have nothing against anybody, my first husband was Muslim, and I say was as he has left this earth now but I do believe that the only way to heaven is through My Lord Jesus Christ. I wish both Candace and Andrew all the best!\",\"This was the best interview I've ever watched. Im much older than the crowd that follows Andrew.\\nI quite wrongly thought i knew exactly what he was. You're 100 % correct, they're putting out old videos to manipulate people. \\nIt works, which is a scary.\\nThank you  Candace. Excellent as always\",\"Thank you for this. I thought Andrew was a rude, vulgar, show-offy misogynist because that's what the media told me. I was wrong. His opinions and values are actually pretty good and I agree with him on many points. So glad I decided to give him a chance and look past what the media was telling me and actually form my own opinion. It was very pleasant as well as surprising and also very humbling to see that he is actually a pretty cool guy with a good moral compass!\",\"yes Andrew no doubt regrets things he said and done in the past we all do, and i would like to live in a world under the ideal that if you make amends and change your behaviour that must mean you have improved as a human being...\\nI believe Andrew has a lot to offer young people who the system has kept down...\\nRespect to you both for showing each other total respect...\",\"What impresses me about Andrew is his willingness to do these inordinately long form interviews.\\n3 hours, 5 hours, etc.\\nSomebody who has something to hide wouldn't open himself up to that.\\nBut even more impressive is that he is so insightful and intelligent in mostly ALL of what he says.\",\"I hope Andrew stays safe he’s too real for this current world of lies\",\"We love you Andrew. You have beaten the matrix. Haters gonna hate!\",\"Respect Andrew ✊ because you all the time avoid watching her eyes. Ma sha alloh ❤\",\"For the first time I heard from Andrew \\\"you know\\\" he usually don't say this phrase\",\"Mahn this was beautiful to watched 💯👌🏽due to this interview I got to kw Andrew better...thanks to Candace👏🏿 two intelligent & intellectual ppl, having meaningful conversations of our current societal issues👏🏿 🙏🏾🥂\",\"This is interview gold.  We love you Candance and Andrew!\",\"Andrew in not the only one planning on bringing \\\"more Andrew Tates\\\" unto the world. *wink wink*\\nHopefully, the next few generations will fix all the stupidity that the past few generations caused.\",\"Andrew looks like Mr.Clean\",\"it blows my mind how can anyone watch this interview with an open mind and still call them crazy and wrong !! they are saying nothing BUT FACTS ! everytime somebody speaks out against the matrix they end up in trouble ! YOU SERIOUSLY THINK THAT IS A COINCIDENCE ???? \\nSpending more time trying to portray andrew like a criminal with 0 evidence  and 0 victims while the REAL criminals of the world are out here laughing by the amount of sheeps and NPC's there are\",\"Andrew is MY HERO.\\nMy dad is #1\\nBut when u need a hero u can watch Andrew Tate.\\nGod bless u!!! God bless u Andrew.\",\"He is a master manipulator \\n\\nAndrew: I’m not sorry for what I did producing porn.. bc other people consume porn and create a market for it 🙄ummm ok 😎 bro\\n\\n*this doesn’t address anything about the morality of his own actions \\nHe takes 0 accountability\\nFurthermore - the difference between him and those people is the people he speaks of consuming porn are not like him-creating a platform to teach men 😂where their main talking points are that sexually liberated women in porn is what is wrong w the world \\nHe is a truly a walking contradiction & a massive hippocrit opportunist and just overall a liar and master manipulator\\n\\nI’m sorry so many of these people are falling for it and being lead astray \\nAnd these interviewers are not doing research asking real questions..they are being soft to help him clean his image to try to win this case that’s looking very bad for him\",\"I’m sure Andrew has done some shit but the idea he is dangerous compared to all the other rappers and Internet personalities is just laughable. And at least half the women saying he is horrible would love to date him\",\"I think Andrew should take on the challenge of conquering satan in America\",\"I seriously belive that once Andrew is encountered heavy by the Holy Spirit things will be changing we will have a huge army filled with warriors of Christ. The world we live in is just plain spiritual warfare we are living our lives in battle every day. But God is too good He will call for His children to rise against this, and I pray that Andrew comes back to the Christian faith. It is not religion it is relationship it's deep and spiritual once he sees that, man, special ops for Jesus Christ will be trained in the name of Jesus!\",\"I really hope people who hate Andrew watch this.\",\"andrew is free\",\"People that don't hear or understand Andrew's message, are docile animals and stuck in the matrix.\",\"This is the best interview of Andrew, lots of respect and little judgement.\",\"Great interview! 👏🏼 \\nAndrew has my full support, I’m glad my son has someone to follow.\",\"Andrew you’re really a role model for us young men to look up to!\",\"Andrew Tate opened my eyes, I became wiser. Andrew is bigger than the Matrix. What a time to be alive !\",\"Something does not add up here.  Why is Andrew talking with the matrix!\",\"I got it!!!!! We should call him \\\"Honest Andrew\\\"!!!!!!!!! Ya know like \\\"Honest Abe\\\"\",\"You can see Andrew getting excited talking about his dad like he is a hero, thats the power of true positive influence.\",\"disgusting and disgraceful. everyone talking about mutual respect. mutual respect? for a convicted criminal? andrew is lying to candace's face for this entire softball puffpiece interview, proving how bad faith it is. she is either grossly negligent, or actually promoting his lies. \\n\\nNOTABLY: candace edits and cuts together a video of him that she plays in this interview, cutting out the part where he openly admits to committing tax fraud and scamming women. video at 1:55:00 contrasted with the entirety of what he says, which can be found in this video at 2:02 and on: https:\\u002f\\u002fyoutu.be\\u002fTOc8LygTlEs\\n\\nlet's not forget that candace's daily wire homies have also admitted he's a liar: https:\\u002f\\u002fyoutu.be\\u002f296r1K5IDAs\",\"Perhaps this is the cleanest interview of Andrew. Can't help but look at Andrew's nipples while listening.\",\"Andrew makes a fool out of Candace Owens here. She and other conservatives need to see this man for what he is; a con artist sex trafficker.\",\"This is an example of a conversation that we should  be watching\\u002f listening on all social media these days, I didn’t know much about Andrew but I agree with most comments here ,great respect for both parties ❤️❤️❤️\",\"This was a poor interview  Candace owens. this guy is too boastful and has no regret for his bad deeds. I cant believe hearing what he is saying admitting what he did to women and you couldnt press him. Andrew has a little truth and the rest of his behaviour and ideas are not Godly.  A real man apologises when he is wrong and cares about other humans especially women.\",\"Candace O,\\nThis is one of the best interview you've produced and Andrew is a GREAT GUY\",\"IMHO, Andrew has never read the bible enough or really truly committed to Christianity.  I think he has always lived as an adult a life satisfying his carnal desires to be with various women and he has resolved to convert to his current religion because he gets to continue his life as he desires to.  He believes a nuclear family is good but doesn’t want it.  He’s very smart but until he gives his life to Jesus wholeheartedly and lives accordingly, he will always be curious or always have a void in his heart which is apparent to me IMHO.  Just saying…\",\"Im gona be completely honest. I don't agree with many of Andrew's insights. Some of them i do, but they're far too sweeping and general. I think he exaggerates a lot and makes claims that aren't entirely justified. However, i really rate him as a speaker. When he speaks i feel motivated to get up and do something. For this, i truly rate him.\",\"I Follow Jesus, and I fuck wit Andrew Tate🫡\",\"Andrew showed how is charm fools women. Candace failed to ask about his video of him making girl think he Loved her then got her to do onlyfans.\",\"Andrew is quite polite. I still believe his pyramid-type online scheme is super scummy, and his ego is a touch too much, but he was respectful to Candace and I hope that shuts some of his naysayers up.\",\"I really like Andrew, John, and Candice. But what are your thoughts?\\nhttps:\\u002f\\u002fyoutu.be\\u002fuLqCS0esFPE\",\"Good try converting Andrew...\",\"Great Interview ! You should definitely have Andrew back on again !\",\"The talk about the culture War, his Libertarian Views and her Conservatism was peak. I love that Andrew changed his mind and saw her as right. He would love to let people be themselves but at some point you have to draw a line because culture pushes past these lines all the time.\",\"I want to like you Candice. I appreciate you interviewing Andrew. I’ve subscribed and will listen to more of your content and try not to judge as I see for myself what you’re “all about”.\",\"I understood why Andrew didn't kept eye contact with her\",\"I used to be scared of Andrew having a platform and now I feel his purpose is much bigger and more important than I realized. I hope he finds his way back to Christianity and becomes a voice for our men and helps us women lean back into our femininity and out of masculinity. He never deserved to be silenced. \\n\\nAndrew if you're reading this please keep speaking up on these values. The world needs you. ❤\",\"I love Andrew ❤️\",\"Thank you for your conversation and incredible input into the society. I am glad that there are people like you two pointing out all the stupidity and manipulation that are being thrown towards humanity. And an extra thank you for Candace for being the first person letting Andrew speaking his mind and letting us hear him. Even though I had seen all this crazy cut out short videos of him I somehow got a good feeling about him. Now I finally had my proof of me being not mistaken. Hope God protect you both.\",\"Candce  ovice  Andrew tete\",\"Andrew should go to Utah, I wonder if he’d feel God 🤔 this was an awesome interview, love how it they actually let each other talk 😂 I’m also really happy they contextualised that video from 10 years ago because I saw that on the Ben Shapiro channel and it threw me for a loop.\",\"Thank you Candice for the interview with Andrew Tate. He’s what is lacking in the west today.  He’s what is known in old school  as a gentleman. Those days are today truly over. Andrew is the only young man today trying to revive what men are suppose to be. Also l too feel sad Andrew is no longer a Christian - . Christianity is not a religion- Christianity is  a personal relations with God  Jesus Christ -   A Christian Life without The Holy Spirit is not a  life - Andrew is a genius-he can research what true  Christianity is- he will find out that it’s not a religion at all.  I love you Candice you’re a gem to the rest of the young women out there. God bless  Andrew God bless you Candice.\",\"❤fan of Andrew....anything he says is right ✅️.  We need more man like this....\",\"Thank you for bringing Andrew on and giving him the chance to have his voice heard without the shenanigans.\",\"Like both these people. Keep calling out the BS. Old man here. I actually would like to hug Andrew and tell him \\\"everything's O.K.\\\". He don't need all the crap. The man needs a good rest.\",\"Andrew's had an epiphany\",\"Finally, after 4 days fitting the time to watch this interview little by little, i got to finish. Great interview overall. \\n\\nI think it was good for Andrew to be indirectly taught by Candace here. Just shows he will do better once he marries a godly woman, but he will need Christ to thrive in marriage..\",\"Sorry Candace but you're a weak host for Andrew. We need more 'substance' and less small talk\\nGod bless'y all\",\"This was such a great interview I have a new found respect for both Candice and Andrew.\",\"I've watched quite a few interviews with the intelligent and charasmatic Andrew. From his body languge it's apparant how Andrew truly came to not only respect Candace, but also realize she could teach him something.The disapointing element of this is that two great minds came together, but the discussion was majorily about repetitive or elanintory topics. I would much rather hear subject matter that we haven't heard previously from these two individuals' stances. However, I believe this is one of the greatest converations that Andrew or Candace has had in the public sphere. My dream is to have JP, Andrew Tate, Charlie Kirk, Candace Owens, and Elon Musk in a room and watch the magic of truth unveil itself in versitile, and somewhat opposing, viewpoints. It is invigorating how our culture deems intellectially stimulating conversations as valuable. I am so grateful for Candace, sacraficing parts in her professional and personall life, to fight for America and for it's children. Candace is certainly a monumental pillar for young women to apire to and emmulate in a society that is being strangled by it's own culture. I am not religious but I do believe in God and their work is done by His will. God bless Candace, your health and your family's health and fortune.\\nMy family and parents are very liberal and think less of me for my ideology and philosophy. I am a conservative American (ethnicity is Gujarati Indian) and a twenty-three years old woman. My intrests include people (psychology), sociology, history, politics, literature, research, writing, and thinking of great questions. I have met no one who is willing or intrested in cultural or political conversations because they either don't know anything about it or they don't care enought to talk about it. In my first political science class in an Oklahoma community college, the first day my male professor declared republicans as evil and musculinity as toxic. My professor in my philosphy class spent 3 weeks, in an 8 week coarse teaching feminism. Thanks to voices like Candace, I finally feel that I have a community and I am not alone and not crazy or unemotional.\",\"i wish Candace used more knowledge of the Bible or Spiritual laws in Christianity to open Andrew’s mind, hopefully she learns about the Islamic faith to counter what Andrew says. Jesus does save, and evil won’t win in the end. A lot of what Tate says aligns with the bible and is quite contradictory to the Quran. Hopefully he picks up the bible!❤\",\"Keep speaking Andrew your words are heard\",\"This is the best post-arrest  interview of Andrew. I’m glad to be new to this channel.\",\"I think Andrew is the realest you can find       Even though he is harsh and real I believe wholeheartedly , that he may put you in your place but will have your back no matter what if your worth your salt 🧂\",\"Video was great, Andrew is spitting facts.. but he’s guilty nonetheless\",\"I used to watch Ethan's podcast and had a negative view of Andrew. However, I stopped watching Ethan's podcast because of his disrespect towards Christianity. Watching this interview changed a lot of my perspective of Andrew. There really is 2 sides to a story.\",\"Candace................from an old lady.............YOU have done the very best interview so far with Andrew.  I watched PBD (Valutainment) conduct an interview.  Patrick himself was excellent, but his sidekick Adam was so smitten with Andrews lifestyle that the majority of the interview was weak.  Andrew had so much respect for PBD that he barely looked at him.  On the other hand \\\"he owned\\\" Adam (polite, but very peacockish).  Tucker Carlson also did a good interview.  HOWEVER..........CANDACE did a \\\"Barbara Walters\\\" type interview.  I believe that she had Andrews COMPLETE and total respect as a strong, articulate woman.  The interview was superb X 10.   ONE thing though.............NOT in regards to the interview but a thought on Candace pushing Tate to become a christian.  There are many religions.  I left the \\\"born again christian\\\" gang after 36 years.  I simply could not do it any longer.  There are excellent Catholics, Muslims, Jews, Mormons etc.........NONE of which proselytize like the \\\"Christians\\\" and think they are the ONLY true religion.  Tate remaining w his new faith is not a threat.  The fact that this young man has grown so much in the last few years is truly amazing.\\nCandace helped the world see that he has changed, matured and IS an excellent influence on young men world wide.  She professionally pushed him, WITHOUT a TINY bit of a \\\"tee hee girly\\\" tone to it..........SIMPLY the best.  Much respect for these two young people\",\"I don't think 🤔 Andrew should do any more interviews. I can find flaws in his reasoning and I can tell he is reaching his limit in regard to patience.\",\"Wow! I am a fan of Andrew but watching this video I feel like I could see right through him\",\"I loved the fact he said we are all programed and that he was programed by his coach among others. Now me knowing his coach is old school military Bosnian man that served in a war  and knowing how tough those men are as my dad is also one, they served in the same army, this truly tells me a lot of his mental strenght. I don't find myself a fan of Andrew I sometimes do mock his bald head and the way he walks and moves I have to confes but I do respect his strenght and see value in what he teaches young men.\",\"I watched this podcast and I seen when he hit the girl with the belt 😂😂 and oh my gosh that was so like a outa knowhere moment and feel bad because it makes him look bad but ok on a serious note if all people recorded and uploaded things like this or different they would like bad and look like a bad person hope Andrew beats this case he deserves it because real people and the elites are the real ones human trafficking people on a high disgusting scale\",\"Leaving aside his past. What Andrew preaches today is extremely important. Especially in the era of wokeness and depravity as we have today. I am glad these people exist and raise their voices because otherwise, the chamber would only echo the voices of the depravity\",\"Excellent interview learnt a lot about Andrew I never knew, I found the information about his father very informative. Well done Candace great job!! Thank you.\",\"Why those christian weird journalists are trying to convert andrew to christianity😂\\nHe is just not interesed \\ncoming back an pagan religion again.\",\"Couldn't finish this one. She talks as much as Andrew does. This is asenine. Let him speak, Noone cares about your opinions and your family life Candace.\",\"Such a great interview. Respect to Candice and Andrew\",\"Gosh,  the 2 of them really built a bond in this conversation.... you can see it... does Andrew have a Podcast?\",\"This interview made me curious about Andrew's father more than about andrew himself 😅\",\"Candace, why did your team (or you) cut out the part of the video where Andrew said he stole money from his cam girls and tax fraud? Looks like the moment one has the same audience or is part of the same political party, all objectivity is thrown out the window. A 5 min research would show enough evidence that the dude is a liar at least. Before he got internet famous he said very disturbing things he did that now he says he haven't done, like dealing drugs. Or using the poverty as a reason to justify his disturbing past while Cardi B is not justified. They both were poor, weren't they? Except, one made fortune out of shady buisness and another didn't. Oh right, and also one is a liberal and another is conservative. Is political parties a cult? Because if you can't hold accountable a person just because they represent the same political stance, it means you basically are part of cult. Consistency, Candace, consistency.\",\"Ok Andrew I started to watch you and Tristan as the media was pushing in my face all this thing about Tate Bros and the lavish life in Romania. I take a few moments to analyse videos I watch as time is my not on my side I m afraid. You and your brother made me laugh initially and I’ve seen you as two clowns but not in a tendentious way more as jokers and good mood inspiring dudes. Then you started to brawl on all subjects a new Tatoiu( Tateoiu) you ve seen what I did there? where you throw out on media things meant to ignite and make people want to hear the sensational the can-can the noise. I’ve dug up more,only to find the webcam was your source of income but now after all these stupid money was made you wanted more-fame. How you get fame these days? Making noise and controversy. I liked you and your charisma and your bro’s even more but as “clowns” entertainers if you d wish. People started to hear about you and you maximised on it and that s fair enough. In this podcast you start to explain how you ve been a douche and dumb on things you ve said but honestly in those clips you were still bragging about how smart and this and that are you(years ago) point is that now you want these young boys to listen to you and follow you and in 5 years to come and say you were a dumb douche as today you re talking-about years ago? I know people will evolve and change and learn,but from a entertainer to a life coach or a temple of morality and principles is a long and hard way. If you re serious about these young boys you should be wise to think what you transmit and inject in their minds teens boys minds are still like sponges as this period will create the men they ll become. My son is 6 and in a few years he might get to your vids but I ll make sure he understands that at least to these days you are an entertainer and not much more maybe a business man and so on but not a life guru. You went to Romania to benefit from the corruption that dices that country every second and you ve started a webcam business were lady’ selling dreams to people that like to pay for such a activity and to make money from it you still need to be smart enough but that s not all about it I m afraid. I have nothing against the business model of webcam or only fans you as a lady or girl you can do whatever you want no an issue here. Struggle is to try to start in life a a good strong base of moral values and high conscience of you actions in a country like Romania where whoever has someone (people money and the connections born between) can take your place everywhere and anywhere. Nothing and no one puts value to the talent and hard working young people and more of that is no one cares if you re smart as it s widely known that you without a “helper” or money you re just a big no one. Live and breath that every day and after 25 years come and tell me how it feels. Go and work on jobs that no one wants as no one wants to work hard and wake up early to get on time at work as there is another way of cheating your life with some “help” that s struggle. You preach things to 12yrs old but not only,if you care at least as much as a black dot under your finger nail think and make up your mind of what you d feed their minds. Social media made you who you are today and your power comes from the views you get but remember -you re as strong as your presence on social media and active,but for my grandma you re no one and again not in a tendentious manner I say this is the reality that should cool you and humble this top g thing a bit not much just a bit. People in the mountains have no idea who you are,make a difference for those who do. Adrian\",\"One thing people need to understand about Andrew. He reverted to Islam in 2022! \\n\\nWhat He did before Islam is forgiven when you become a Muslim. However, if he has done wrong to someone he needs to sort it out and apologize. However, if there are no one to apologize than his past sin are all forgiven when he becomes a Muslim. \\n\\n\\nHe has said and done weird things but when he became a Muslim he is changing and becoming a better person, If God Wills.\",\"I really like this man.  He's honest and steps up... which is hard to find today. He's very intelligent...respect him as such. \\nGod bless you Andrew. ❤\",\"I came here to listen for a few minutes and finished all 3 hours. Andrew is very interesting to listen to and has great views on our corrupt society today\",\"How many times will Andrew repeat the same answers to bunk interviewers asking the same questions? Show me something new.\",\"Andrew is the man\\nGood man!!!!!\\nEmbrace.....\",\"I LOVED this interview. It's nice to see Andrew talk with a woman who he respects because we get a real interview and we get to see a different side of Andrew.. and Candice is always amazing :)\",\"1:44:50 I think you interrupted Andrew about 5-6 times in that one minute. FFS.\",\"I have a question for andrew... when is the book coming out?🤔🤔🤔🤔\",\"I’ll use this interview to introduce to Andrew people who may not like the more aggressive content. He’s still genuinely him but he’s keeping it gentleman.\",\"Andrew will rerun to Christianity when he himself reads the Quran and the Hadith just like many others are doing these days.\",\"Great interview, I like Andrew, I have never thought he was misogynistic, the onky thing I'd say is, that Harry while a weak man, I belive he got away from the Royal family for a different reason, King Charles is part of those elites Andrew talks about that want to control you and take your liberties away, he is heavily involved with WEF and the whole climate scam. But other than that I agree with everything else you guys discussed.\",\"There's mountains of puzzle pieces out there for people to piece together the clues and form a picture of what monsters the Tates are yet Andrew in particular keeps being platformed in countless podcasts and interviews where they're allowed to spread their twisted message and denials.\",\"Andrew tate❤\",\"Andrew such a intelligent human bein Mashallah and she’s lucky to sit down with a man full of wisdom.\",\"Absolutely intriguing conversation. Andrew is an interesting person. I just pray that he surrenders His life to Jesus Christ. That is the most masculine thing a man can do.\",\"I don't think Andrew has ever talked to a low value woman for that long.\",\"Men are out of order with God so everything falls from that .. can I say thank y’all for this podcast becauseeeee I love you both !!! And I love Andrew’s submission and his spiritual journey also his maturity !! Candance you listened you asked his about Christianity gracefully and y’all just had an amazing conversation!! I did not want it to enddddd we ❤ to see it !!\",\"Andrew’s problem is he isn’t part of the globalist club.  He is not invited to a private island to rape children.\",\"1:12:16 Imagine telling someone who is severely depressed, because you know, our brains and our lives aren't all the same, that therapy won't help. Mental problems were here before Andrew and will be here after Andrew and help is needed. telling those people that they are just crying babies and should off themselves is not the solution. Andrew being a pro fighter should know how important the mind is and how can determine a fight or match, for example. Not to talk about people that go to war and came back all fucked up in the head.\",\"Brilliant Andrew 👏\",\"Amazing interview love them both ❤️\\nMore strength to both of them and I really hope Andrew is proven innocent\",\"This is an amazing interview, the way the media portrayed Andrew is a 180 from this interview, as I was not a fan of him because of media  and how they portrayed him vs watching this whole interview is mind-blowing, thank you for having this interview so some of us, like myself can wake up.\",\"I started watching Andrew over the last few months while I was in a bad place mentally and physically. Smoking weed every day, body went to shit, watching porn everyday. After watching him over the course of the last few months I haven’t watched porn in over a month, I’m in the best shape of my life and quit smoking weed everyday. All I have to say is they are making Andrew Tate a villain when he is indeed the superhero! Thank you Candace for a great interview and thank you Andrew for motivating me to be a better, stronger more intelligent male!\",\"I loved what Andrew said about making your man look and feel important… it’s very easy for us to mother and belittle our men unintentionally and this made me realize that I’m guilty of that.\",\"Love love love this interview!

Does that make you jealous?\",\"I love Andrew but the wording in that clip was very bad lol when he said you need to f the girl before you mention webcam you can come work for me then the phd test doesn't seem like a dating course I think Andrew is great for the world this is not hate at all\",\"I love Andrew for his true honour as a man now and his strong character against the slave mind\",\"Ps this was a much needed reminder video that we needed it’s like a knife slashing through the bull shyt that we needed to hear for yearsssss now because the bull shyt has taken over! I also truly truly admire and appreciate the fact that you guys talked and listened to each other—it wasn’t a talking over competition you guys actually cared what each other had to say and let each other speak! Soooo good I could watch it again lol Let’s make a dating show for Andrew id watch 😀\",\"This is a very enlightening conversation and I must say that I have come to view Andrew completely differently because of it. Thanks Candace for this interview.\",\"Andrew converted to Islam for protection and networking in the UAE, not religion. Life is one big chess game after all. Atheists don't have a power center and are too fragmented to be of any help so Andrew had to get protection from somewhere, especially once they started messing with his money and kicking him out of the system.\",\"Wow!  I was riveted to this marathon interview.  Andrew DOES repeat himself and his ideology often but it was obvious that he was speaking from the bottom of his soul about things that he is consumed by and wants to be heard about.  Like Candace, I don't agree with EVERYTHING Andrew thinks or believes.  However, ALSO like Candace, I discerned very early in the interview that he has transitioned a LONG way towards truth and goodness and that he still hungers for more.  He's not perfect, but he IS real, and that in itself greatly enhances the likelihood of his continued spiritual maturation.   Additionally, I love the way that Candace developed a lot of common ground with him  and then gently, progressively, encouraged him to look differently at some issues where his mindset is still worldly and shallow, (without labeling them as such).   I could tell she was really provoking heartfelt contemplation on his part.\",\"Andrew is that dude. Before I watched him I would do  with 50 push ups a week. Now I do over 50 a day with my eyes closed. Additionally - since he told Adin he’d smack him about consuming lean - I took that advice myself and became sober. Don’t wanna get decked by a Tate. Keep up the good fight my friend !\",\"Young boys\\u002fmen love Andrew because he’s the father figure they don’t have or the father they do have is a woke weakling with zero masculinity.\",\"this is one of my favorite interviews with Andrew\",\"I like Andrew more now for accepting he is not proud of his past. We all have things are aren't proud for but we change.❤\",\"Lasanbi will look at this and not agree with a single point andrew made.\",\"Andrew will def be remembered in history\",\"Banking on Andrew Tate uhhh?  Who's next? Oprah? Andrew you can do better then the daily wire.\",\"I have High IQ and I see Andrew Is Highly Intelligent, I believe I truly believe after deep analysis that he's reserving his full potentia out of sight. \\n\\n like in the back of his mind he knows the world 🌎 is not ready for what he actually is.\\n\\nI hope the world develops now or never the spirit of openness. To allow what is to come\\n\\n We are yet to see the individual's Growth and Impact on the World's History, \\n\\nMark my words.\",\"Does anyone else think it’s odd how Andrew isn’t actually engaging in direct eye contact with Candace? Just staring into the corner 🤔\",\"History made. We will study you Andrew. \\nRespect ✌🏾\",\"Just like many people said, he may have the right diagnosis for many societal issues,but his prescriptions aren't the best to say the least. \\nNot everything that is legal is good. \\nAndrew's ego is too big. What is his success -Body count? Money he's made? That does not make one a solid role model.\\nNot being able to admit when he's wrong, or have any regrets - is not a good sign. Real men don't apologize? What kind of standard of behavior is that? Those videos from his past are disturbing and disgusting. \\nLike Chris Williamson and others who care about men, I hope there will emerge other - real - role models for men. \\nStop promoting Andrew Tate.\",\"It's funny how Candace and I both wished that Andrew is a Christian. I'm praying for you Andrew Tate. Your Mom must be very proud of you. Please keep up your spirit and don't forget that it's all in God's mercy that you're going through some trials right now.  \\nPlease keep on spreading God's teachings.😊\\nI learned about Andrew Tate from my daughter who's opinion about him intrigued me. Hence, I started watching his interviews. The moment he said that he fear God the most, I'm convinced that he's a good person. That he's not who they said he is. 👍\\nI admire him for being honest about his past actions when he was younger. That he's embarrassed about the past actions that he's done. (Which sadly was recorded for others to see and use against him.) But it's a good example for our young one's to learn from. To not get so hooked up on recording and posting everything on social media!👍👍\\nGod bless you, Andrew Tate.🙏\",\"I find it interesting that Andrew says he can’t stand by what was said back in the day and he basically is addressing something that is tarnishing his reputation, but in the same vein he says in other podcasts that men can’t be with a woman who ever had a history or situation that could potentially embarrass him. In this same situation, a woman in relationship with him, could be embarrassed by HIS past. At the end of the day, live by standards, and your values, if you’ve made mistakes in the past it doesn’t mean you’re a failure in your life and you have every day your alive to write your own story. Don’t let someone else, including this man, tell you what your value is, man or woman. 🤷🏾‍♀️ to err is human, and humanizing people should be normal and that’s men AND women.\",\"Andrew is a true hero .... a blessing for young people\",\"A very intelligent interesting inspiring individual. May god be with you andrew ❤\",\"I think that you Candace are a true woman, and I think that Andrew is a true man. Thank you both for doing this interview.\",\"Top G ❤ how can you hate Andrew Idk\",\"I like the fact that Andrew honours his father and the way he speaks about his father in such loving and respectful way. Andrew can actually write a book about his father. It will be a hit.❤ And the world will benefit from it. Memoirs from a great master.🎉🎉🎉\",\"Fantastic, two of my most favourite (english spelling) people sitting together. One of the best chats I've listened to in forever. Love having you back Andrew\",\"One of the best interviews ever. It was nice to listen to two people having an intelligent conversation on so many issues were facing. Would like to see more of you and Andrew. I am a fan of Andrew and have been since the first time I heard him with his message to men.\",\"Andrew as a current Muslim should not sit-down with that satanic couple that sells porn to young kids, He should have refused to be featured there.\",\"Thank you for this interview. Incredible 3 hours hearing you and Andrew discuss and talk about important things going on in the world. Andrew is an intelligent man and he's a voice for a lot of men that struggle in today's feminist society.\",\"Andrew rate is a ridiculous charlatan. \\n“We Christian’s could have used you” \\nGive me a break.\",\"I loved this guy since the first interview I heard he did with some feminist who tried to check him but failed just like all others. None of us are perfect like he said and we all grow and learn and I even respect him more for not apologizing. As a woman who is Muslima who lives in the US for the past 28 years, he truly is a fresh of breath air and reminds me so much of my father’s attitude May Allah rest his soul and the souls of all the amazing fathers that passed 🤲🏼 Young men need more Andrew Tâtes and I pray to Allah that he rewards him according to his pure intentions and I pray he always keep him, his kids and family healthy, with inner peace and keep the crazy away from them. I beyond appreciate his honesty and non apologetic attitude. Thank you 🙏🏼\",\"Loved loved loved this video - I can’t believe 3hrs have just flown by I could sit and listen to you two for another 3hrs - just brilliant - candace you brought the very best out of Andrew you were both extremely respectful of the other and the end result was just brilliant - thankyou❤\",\"Loved this interview and love Andrew Tate. The difference in this interview is Candace.  She seems to have a real relationship with him and it shows. Andrew seems very relaxed and thats great to see.\",\"Why andrew has his hands like that while being interviewed? Is that a symbol ?\",\"This was such a great interview. Admittedly I was never a fan of Andrew just based on videos I had seen circulating social media. But wow, this interview really changed my mind on him. He is not who I thought He was and I wish More people were exposed to this instead of all of his old videos.\",\"Andrew is the New Mecca for podcast from PBD to Tucker Carlson and now CandaceO. The man is a master communicator. This is what mainstream media dont know anymore how to do with their agenda\",\"Andrew should have come to Iran.\",\"Like Andrew is such a smart and reasonable man but he goes on these trashy podcasts and sounds like a complete asshole. I’m not sure if he just does it for entertainment or that’s who he really is but whenever I see him off these trashy podcast he sounds so intelligent and educated.\",\"The same people that are \\\"upset\\\" with Andrew are the same ones that are sabatoging Sound of Freedom.\",\"Andrew's efforts in lowering the gaze 👌 Masha'Allah\",\"All the christian interviewers wants to convert Andrew, why do they refuse the truth that far, why don't they actually look into Islam with their own eyes instead of the Islamophobic western eyes and revert  like Andrew did.\",\"I got to say I do really like Andrew, he is honest forthright and does not suffer fools gladly, we all did dumb stuff when we were young and I do not believe the accusations that have been made against him,  its just fashionable to be  \\\" A Hater\\\" or as my son would say A Social Justice Warrior ,  the BBC treated Andrew appallingly it was not a interview it was a accusatory interrogation, from a poorly informed \\\" journalist\\\" who was clout chasing,\",\"Candice trying to convert Andrew to Christianity 😭\",\"Top G and Can-dace (Andrews annunciation). Andrew will be the leader of a revolution some day. Mark my words. Great interview. Thank you.\",\"Man Andrew you are truly a role model .. love you top G\",\"We need more men like Andrew influencing our boys and young men. I am in complete agreement with him and Candace on the conspiracy.\",\"Andrew because you have bad feelings about christianity and jesus. You going to hell bro because jesus is the only way the truth and the ETERNAL LIFE you going to heaven only if you know that jesus is everything he is god he was and is\",\"Andrew is a great guy. Great interview!!\",\"All Andrew needs is to accept Jesus Christ has his Lord and Savior and he would be one remarkable individual...\",\"Religiously I disagree with Andrew but that aside, I served my country for 21 years to give the right to worship whatever you want.  As a Christian we should not be judging.  BUT MAN, he made such a good point, \\\"how can satan be worshipped in the streets!\\\"  DANG!!!  This man spew's NOTHING BUT TRUTH.  It is no wonder why young men follow him.  Keep it up man!\",\"Andrew is the man. I went from 240 LBS to 205 LBS in 6 months and got off of medication from his message. Keep fighting the good fight\",\"Just remember guys and girls, Andrew will never ever kill himself\",\"As a 50+ man, I laughed when he said. \\\"I might look back 20 years later and think you were an idiot\\\" Yes Andrew, you will. This is why I listen to him and let things slide that he says. I work out and take care of myself and use to explain to people why they are fat or why they look the way they look. When you go to the gym the subject comes up. Then you come across as arrogant and somehow better than others. And 20 years will change everything honestly. If you work out or not you will age, and everything will change. I was a wrestler in High school and considerably good at it. I also voted for Bill Clinton and defended him for the oval office incident and am now a Trump supporter. So, I can relate to both Candace and Andrew and understand where they are coming from. We are here to live and learn in life and it bothers me when people know nothing about Andrew Tate except a few old clips online, and they have no problem talking shit about him. None of them know him really? (Candace\\u002fsame) Also, If we don't like a person and we don't want our children paying attention to them. We wont sway them away from that person\\u002fpeople by just bad mouthing them passionately. This will only make our children watch or give their time to them even more.\",\"I love Andrew Tate... and Candace, of course. I'm 38\\u002ff, and I was raised by my single father with my 2 brothers.. one older and one younger... and Andrew's message is exactly how my dad raised us. I just love it. I wish that more men had the mindset of Andrew tate. My 18 yr old daughter hates him,..\\\"have you heard what he says!?\\\" (I said well maybe you should hear him in his own words... sent her this interview, and the one with tucker)... however, my 12 yr old son loves him... it's so great😊.\",\"What Andrew needs to do is write a book!!! Seeing how the younger generation is growing up and how the media in US  is trying to break them make them weak... Everything he says can benefit the teens of today and make them strong men in the future. IF YOU HAPPEN TO SEE THIS MR. TATE take your time on house arrest and write a book!! Teach the teens of today how to be men tomorrow\",\"The men that dont like andrew’s point if view generally do because they dont measure up.  He has grown and changed alot.  He has become truly dangerous to the establishment because they put him in prison. What came out is a much more refined and mature man that is even better.\",\"My son is a fan of Andrew and so am I.\",\"Andrew not feeling sorry about any of his previous decisions is indicative of who he is today. Being unapologetic for being disgusting in the past means your morals haven’t changed. Super weird he could look Tucker in the eyes but avoids Candace’s.\",\"Loved this convo. There were so many valuable points, and it was great to get to hear Andrew's side of his legal issues. 💛\",\"Who can point out all the double standards, misogyny, misandry etc on everyone who has spoken to Andrew and also Andrew himself.\",\"I have not heard of Andrew until I watchedTucker today. This world has gone insane. Let this man go. If there is no witness he needs to be freed,\",\"Andrew has a voiced and opinion that the majority of the people agree with him,he is gifted. 😉 👏 👌 😀\",\"this guy is going to go to jail for the rest of his life all of you can support him but just you wait, the evidence against him is incredibly substantial, when that trial comes around bye bye andrew\",\"Andrew needs to be more honest about what he's done\",\"I don't really know who Andrew is or what exactly he does. But he seems like a stand up dude to me.\",\"Andrew and Candace for president and vice president\",\"WoW! for the first time Andrew addressed that old video and webcam business, I didn't see it anywhere else. He has grown past year dramatically, big changes happened. Interesting to see two ppl, who went through life changing transformations past 5 years, talk and dig.\",\"No one hates Andrew , what a goat 🙏\",\"This has been my favorite interview yet specially because Candice brought up all the concerns circulating media about him. Andrew really is my super hero! Because he’s taught me I owe myself being better!\",\"I find it strange Andrew can’t look Candace in the eyes more than a couple seconds before having to look away. Unless maybe there are others in the room (off camera) he’s including in the conversation?\",\"The biggest message I hear from Andrew is that you need a father figure that will make you a strong man mentally…\",\"Love how Andrew talks about his family; especially about his brother and his dad…\",\"Candice.....your cred just went up in my book! Andrew is indeed one of the good guys!\",\"This is the most intelligent conversation between two black people honorable black people at that. I love it Andrew reminds me of my sons. They are in their 20's and the sound like him. They view the world like and it makes me soooo proud.\",\"1:55:06 I like most of the interview but guys we all know that the excuse he came up with here for making that video was a straight of dodge of the question and lie, he was literally teaching guys how to use girls they been with to make money out of them, he wasn’t explaining shit about “how he told the girls he made money”. I love andrew but he be lying sometimes for real\",\"May God protect Andrew Tate🙏🏽 \\nHe is absolutely wide awake to the Matrix and that is exactly why they want to destroy him.. he is dangerous to their plans for control, he has the influence to wake the masses up!! 👏🏽\",\"Let’s just admire how much Andrew as grown within the past year! Man just was speaking facts on life & women & the world wanna cancel the TRUTH!\",\"Downloading this right now...Tucker Carlsons interview with Andrew was great hope this is as well!\",\"This lady is trying way too hard to agree with all of Andrew's talking points...\",\"Salaam alaikum brother Andrew\",\"am from a 3rd world country and I tell you i cant want my pasty dig up bro, leave Andrew alone baBE.\",\"Yes. Nuclear traditional family is preferred but let Andrew be Andrew.\",\"Just finished the interview. They just agreed with each other for 3 hours. Candace, with all due respect, didn't provide an interesting interview. As for Andrew, whom I genuinely find interesting and is a character, this was such a cop out interview from him. Everything he said was excuses and cop out. But gg.\",\"Andrew should have done better research to understand Christianity. If he had done he would not have converted.\",\"Refreshing to see an unedited Andrew Tate interview for once. Thank you both Andrew and Candace\",\"I am glad Andrew went on the show with Adam and Lena so that all the lost souls could see the light.\",\"I've noticed Andrew possess two great traits; critical thinking and lateral thinking. It allows him to deconstruct and answer 'what would be' hard, annoying, intense questions in seamless fashion. Must be the fact that playing chess at a high level runs in the family.\",\"Andrew is a great man\",\"Thank you both. So proud of you brother Andrew. God \\u002fAllah bless you both\",\"If they want to hold Andrew to account for his webcam business, are we going to drag the CEO of OnlyFans through the coals 🤣\",\"love how andrew talks about no man is safe, cos he has multiple videos of himself as well as a full pimping hoes degree available to purchase on how to trick women into doing porn. and he thinks cos they're after him for it, none of us are apparently safe.\",\"I loooove when Andrew talks about his father! He must’ve been extraordinary!\",\"Yeah, well, I watched enough videos in which Andrew and his brother explain exactly who they are and how they operate, namely ruthless exploitation of vulnerable people and milking them for everything they've got. The loverboy method... at 1:51:20 he describes it, pretending that he didn't do that, but there are many clips online where he is boasting about how he is doing exactly that: luring in fragile girls, hiding his true intentions (what he creepily calls 'being a nice person') and soon placing them behind webcams on O.F. in houses in Eastern Europe... Their casinos, in cohorts with Romanian maffia, where they exploit addicted people and hopeful dreamers... And today they exploit impressionable boys and young men who have difficulty finding their way in these weird times. But in Tate's eyes THEY TOO (you?) are a brokey, 'a loser to be exploited'! Just listen to him literally saying it. This whole \\\"I have been placed in a position where there's always someone attacking me\\\" is weak. He placed himself where he is. 27:17 is a nice example: he says he 'saw dudes spending hundreds of thousands of dollars'. He didn't 'see' that: he DID that. While girls were on camera, not they, but he and his brother would be typing. They would manipulate these guys to give 'her' everything they had. A vile and criminal scam. They both tell you exactly who they are, if you are willing to listen. Many people are not, for some creepy reason. As smart and entertaining as Tate may be, he is bad, bad people. Not to mention that incubussy little brother of his.\",\"Abu Andrew for President!\",\"No wonder the Deep State globalists don't like Andrew.... it's a huge compliment\",\"I love how real and embarrassed Andrew is for he’s “stupid” actions in his twenties. \\n\\nHe is a genuine person. He is unapologetic about being a human being who isn’t perfect and who has and is likely to make a mistake. \\nBecoming a public figure doesn’t make you a Angel or automatically turn you into God Andrew Tate is a human being and human beings are error prone.\",\"Such a great interview. Andrew is 1 in a million. I truly hope the young boys who look up to him transform the future for the better. And change these awful disgraceful social norms today.\",\"Love him or hate him, Andrew hits the nail on the head....Candace and Andrew.....you say what needs to be reiterated in todays society\",\"Marry me Andrew! 😘\",\"I really love everything about this interview, great job@RealCandace. Andrew was never my kind of guy.  However after listening to him I think I like him, he made some great points, take me back to the saying never judge someone until you hear their side of the story because there is always three sides to any stories, your side, my side and the truth and the fact that all the ladies he had a relationship with have nothing bad to say about him I honestly believe him and think they need to give the guy a break.\",\"Wow, the views Andrew bring to others' platform is unbelievable. Everyone wanna hear what he has to say❤\",\"You made this a very sweet interview Candace . I love that Andrew had so many questions for you . He sought your advice because he respected you. I truly hope he takes heed and marries. Also, I didn’t know those videos were so old & he was so young in them. It adds perspective to the saga .\",\"Andrew..you don't have and empire.\\nNobody knew who you were till you started popping up on every social media CLAIMING..you were banned by every social media. And that's when SM enthusiast began googling \\\"Who is Andrew Tate\\\"..hence dubbing you the most googled person on the planet.\\n\\nYou flash and brag about your luxurious lifestyle..but nobody knows how and by what means you got rich. That is the reason you are being investigated. I believe you are helping Cartels to wash $.\",\"Thank you Candace, I wish more hosts in the DW gave Andrew the opportunity you gave him. Rather than speaking on old clips.... Looking at you Smokey Mike \\u002f Ben\",\"Wonderful, intelligent conversation, Candace. You are one of the most respected, beloved young journalists & we are grateful for your valuable content. Andrew T. is one of the most decent, most important  MEN !!!!!!! (truly man) in our deranged times. Thank you both keep up the good work speaking to us.\",\"i feel like i wanna hug andrew, they feel like a dad or an uncle\",\"I didn’t know Andrew’s father was black.\",\"I think this is the most relaxed ive seen either them - especially Andrew, in an interview. He seemed to have really enjoyed it and into the conversation. I know im late to it but now looking forward to his Tucker Carlson interview.\",\"Nice to see a different side of Andrew. Don’t agree with everything but I always enjoy hearing good dialogue. Great job interviewing him Candace!\",\"This is not Candace or Andrew. How she all the sudden have a white pig different size nostril nose and now Andrew says me and my brothers. Then says other words trying to avoid saying the matrix??? Just saying.\",\"He is the man, I'm so grateful for your honesty. GOD BLESS YOU ANDREW!!!!!\",\"I pray Andrew finds Jesus Christ in Jesus name\",\"Appreciation for Candace, Andrew can't stand here. She has defended her faith and refuted the lies Andrews speaks all the time and it is obvious when she came up with a good example, Andrew ran away  from his attempt.\\n\\n\\n\\nI wish I could ever sit with Andrew and clear his mind on God and Christianity. He should re-think that if he is going after the 'God must be feared' statement then he is the one who does not consider God when he is alone.\",\"2:07:10 fantasy play as andrew being the cuck punishing his cheating wife\\n\\nrofl!!!\",\"Undeniable proof Andrew and his brother are bad people   https:\\u002f\\u002fyoutube.com\\u002fshorts\\u002fwHcuNwbplPE?feature=share\",\"Candace great interview.

If you notice he has little eye contact with her when talking\",\"Andrew is AMAZING! More young me n need to become like him, then the world wil heal.\",\"A bit shocking to hear Andrew say Christians attack him. I've not heard or seen any online. How does he know if those accounts that he claims attack really are Christian? I doubt they are. Real Christians don't do that, and he should know that. Other than that, great interview.\",\"What a fantastic interview. Andrew has a great outlook and I agree, as a woman, I want a strong man that I know can take care of me and the children both physically and financially and still be loving and caring to us.\",\"This was amazing! Andrew needs to have an interview with Jesse Lee Peterson too!\",\"Loved this interview! Saw Andrew in a whole different light.

W.\",\"I love Andrew Tate.... I met his father at a chess tournament in California... I have his father's BEST CHESS Games Collection.  He was an incredible player... I'm an expert level just trust me... As far as andrew goes his core message of powerful Masculinity is awesome... There's nothing wrong with wanting to be strong physically with wanting to make a lot of money with driving super cars with having beautiful girlfriend or girlfriends... Those TOXIC FEMINISTS are nothing but a bunch of JEALOUS  INEFFECTIVE wanna be Cancel culture Negative people !   We LOVE ❤  WOMEN, we PROTECT women... women cherish us we cherish them...

The Tate's are the most successful cult leaders of all time\",\"power is an illusion nobody is in control as much as they think they are protect andrew tate\",\"i avoided watching this podcast for so long ....... because i was  fed lies by media that andrew tate is a terrible person .......i didn't know what to expect in this .......i was afraid it will be too absurd ........i was not expecting him to be so polite and put such good logical arguments........i now understand why boys and men follow him .......he is  a man and a traditional man who has a warrior mentality that because he is a man he should toughen up and face all highs and lows without complaints.......and stands his ground\",\"I absolutely love interviews where it’s very well conducted where both people are respectful. Also, not to many interviewers are willing to let the interviewee speak their mind and get full thoughts out. She’s insanely well put together. If I had a kids, i’d be showing her them her as a role model. She’s extremely intelligent and well put together. \\n\\nAndrew Tate is, in my opinion, a very good role model in my eyes. Yes, he’s made mistakes but we all do. He takes responsibility for those mistakes and has grown to become a better human being. Trying to make a role model out of so called “perfect” people is impossible. \\n\\nTo those who hate him, you’re the reason why he’s so big. I saw him become big and had no idea who he was. Ever since 2017-2018, I have made my own opinion on people. I looked into him, didn’t understand the hate and now I take his advice on how to be a man.\\n\\nI have a lot to learn and grow but I am on a better track. Thank you for this interview.\",\"The way Tate smile when she mentioned marriage, you can see he looks forward to that, but he pretty much need a genius, spiritual soulmate that mentally on his level to match his energy which is pretty hard to find. CAN WE HAVE MORE OF THESE CONVERSATIONS PLEASE I REALLY BELIVE BOTH YOU GUYS HAVE GREAT IMPACT ON THE WORLD!❤💪🏾 #candace #tate\",\"I love the conversation how it flows how respectful they are to each other.... However I also see the major red flags of a narcissist in Tate. How if you listen closely he plays the victim by saying he's not\",\"My 15 year old Grandson listens to Andrew tate often.  It is shaping his goals in so many good ways, i don't always agree with him, but he is teaching him to have bigger goals.  Regardless of accusations based around hate, that is aimed at him, he speaks a lot of thruth and NOT afraid to say it as it is. Thank you Mr Tate and Thank you Candace Owens❤\",\"I’ve never been a fan of Andrew Tate. But in his defense that was the much younger version of himself that I knew very little of. After doing my own research & watching this interview he has more than grown on me. I will go as far as to say I’m becoming a fan.\",\"They both talk really fast. I’m trying to pay attention 😂 Tate seems like a very straightforward guy that is set in his ways… Thanks Candace for keeping up with him and trying to relate to him…\",\"First time I’ve seen Andrew Tate so relaxed and at ease. He even entertained the thought of really getting married. Great conversation. Watched it all.\",\"Wow I mean I love hearing Candace speak and her viewpoints on the topics in life that make other people uncomfortable. I’ve always written off Andrew Tate didn’t even bother to hear him speak.. this is the first time I’ve heard the man talk and for 3 hours at that and wow this man is nothing short of wisdom. This goes to show how when you turn to God he will give you wisdom. Wisdom is by far the greatest gift given to humanity.\",\"I stumbled across a clip of this interview when you got in to the topic of Christianity.  That small clip really got to me emotionally so I searched for the entire interview and I'm watching it now.  I love this interaction between the two of you.  The level of respect and willingness to listen is incredible.  I didn't know much about Andrew Tate prior to this interview but I had no reason to think anything negative about him because I think for myself and the few things I had heard, made no impact on my perception of him.  Seeing and listening to him during this interview has given me a level of great respect for him and how he presents himself.  The things he does align with what he says.  He speaks articulately and is clearly highly intelligent.  I'm so glad that small clip appeared on my YouTube channel.  Great interview..thank you Candace!\",\"This interview is hilarious. Shes quoting scripture one day, defending scripture and then supporting a man like andrew tate. She did eveything but drop to her knees in this interview. Shes as fake as they come.\",\"Wow.

You don't do that, EVER\\n\\n@Ms Candace, I really hope deep in your soul, you realize why this promotiin material (it can't be called an interview) is so wrong and damaging\",\"She said Andrew Tate \\\"STAN\\\" 🥹\",\"How do you support Tate when he bragged about taking simps(weak man’s) money to look at poor Russian women (pretty much the women) on cam that he put online. I am seriously behind u and love what u do I just really want to know how u can smile in rates face with glittering eyes but be so strong in ur debate against the sex worker who is pretty much one of the women he would love to exploit. I don’t get it . Please Candace explain as a women who wants to get behind the republican\\u002fConservative party bc I’m so sick of the democrats who will destroy my 4 year old sons life with perverse thoughts\",\"With respect, Candace came totally unprepared for this interview. The court documents are there and the chat logs and videos are all available for people to see. Tate didn't even have the courage to talk to Candace face to face. He looked at her for a couple of seconds and quickly shifted his look in another direction.\",\"Andrew Tate is changing our men for the better.\",\"Wow, Candace…I used to be a fan of yours, even bought one of your books. I’ve seen you be wrong in the past, but never like this. \\n\\nAndrew Tate is not a guy who is being wrongfully accused, because he’s touting masculinity; he is actually a human trafficker, who has openly admitted to misleading women to believe that he loves them and wants to marry them, to get them to move to his country and then he pimps them out. He has also admitted that he enjoys slapping them around, and that “rape is awesome.”\\n\\nBTW, the most correct thing you said was that you know nothing of Islam, because if you did, you would understand what attracted this guy to that ideology. \\n\\nYou really need to read at least part of the Quran, specifically Surah 4, the chapter entitled “The Woman.”  It will tell you everything you need to know about how Muslim men are expected to treat women, how they are allowed to beat them into submission, if they even suspect a woman is going to disobey them. \\n\\nDon’t take my word for it; just google Quran Surah 4. Spoiler Alert:  Muhammad married a six year old girl, and consummated the marriage (began raping her) when she was 9. That’s why in Iran, a Sharia-compliant hell hole, 9 year old girls are considered adults. \\n\\nBoy, you played right into his greedy, immoral hands with this softball interview.\",\"why tate doesnt look her in the eyes when he is talking? if you look other interviews is different he looks in the eyes.\",\"Hi, Ms Owens and hi, Mr. Tate, I just really want to meet you Mr. Tate, because I want to know how you work, and I learned know how you work out, and I want to be strong like you, I want to meet you all it's gonna be like a vacation or something, but at the same time, I want to work hard, I want to know how you get money, I just want to be your pupil, because I feel like that at school, people aren't respecting me enough, and I'm not trying to impress my friends or anything. I'm not gonna tell them this every year, happen if it does, but I just want to let know that if you see this message I will not take no as an answer I really want to know if I can meet you again, I don't want to impress, I need friends, I'm 12, you're 30, something doesn't matter. If I meet you, when you're 50 are 60 are 70, I want to know how you get your money, because me as a young guy, I just wanted to know.\",\"Vice news The Dangerous Rise of Andrew Tate more like The EPIC Rise of the Cobra\",\"Jesus Christ, 😂😂😂 Imagine 10 Andrew Tate 😂😂😂\",\"Tate, you are a toxic Misogynist and you will be exposed. You think you know how to be a winner but your money doesn't make you a winner. Your inner soul is void of any value. Any man who follows your advice is going to be as lost as you. May the Maker of Heaven and Earth call you into judgment in this life and on Judgment Day for your evil words.\",\"Never imagined that was andrew Tate's voice😂😂😂😂😂\",\"Tate is one of the best things that has happened in the 21st century.

I will say this, both individuals are well spoken. Andrew is genuine in the sense that he understood what he did wrong in the past. He takes accountability for his actions and that’s certainly something most can’t do. Part of growth\\u002fevolution is change. It sounds like he has made some changes in his life for the best.\",\"Andrew Tate will always be Andrew Tate 😄 I don’t know what I was expecting when I clicked on this; but then I got Andrew Tate in his full form, from the start 😅\",\"Andrew Tate vs Ben Shapiro\\nDream debate: it might never happen!\",\"Tate needs to be Trumps Vp and then president after.\",\"Not all men want to be like tate and not all women are like Candace said. If so you must assume by her own reasoning that all women are based on emotion not reason. That being said she should  be an at home mother and not have a job because that makes her a femenist! Apparently those are her own words. They are both hipocrites. The conservatives and liberals are both liars and like to twist up the dif sides. I refuse to believe either of them 100% and I honestly don't know no one knows the truth about Tate. The fact is he still is a sexist who thinks it's not ok for me to tell him how a man should be, but it's ok for him to tell women how to be. \\n\\nTo call us irrational and driven off of emotions.

I don’t agree with his chauvinist and “self love before selfless love” (aka narcissist)tendencies, but I believe in the good that he has in him, he seems like a good dude deep down, he’s just been through a lot. I pray that Jesus opens his eyes to his glory and splendor, and fills his life with peace and comfort.❤️\",\"I think Andrew Tate went from athiest, to Christianity to Islam because of his personal issues. What I mean is if you listen to him talk over time. He has been a playboy. He has found that he can control woman in his life and they respect him because they fear him. He likes that. But then he has children. He scares himself with how far he has found he can let himself go in certain areas and that's terrifying to him. So first he looks for redemption and he finds that in Jesus Christ. But he's looking at Christianity and he goes, how can this religion protect my children? Look at all these \\\"Christians\\\" they don't stand for anything. They accept everything. The are so \\\"tolerent\\\" it has allowed the level of corruption in this \\\"Christian\\\" nation to get to a point that it is beyond disturbing and ready to collapse. But collapse to what. What can protect us. So then he's no longer focused on redemption. He knows how evil he has gone in his life. He's afraid of that. He knows his kids aren't safe in this society and he's right. So now he's focused on looking for a Being of power that he not only fears enough to control himself,  but will also control others and protect his wives and children. He feels he's found that in Islam. They stand up for what they believe in. They shut down what they see wrong and evil. They are not tolerant of it. It fits him well,  unlike what he perceives as a religion with no teeth. Agency for everyone to be as evil as they choose and somehow we must tolerate everything or we aren't living the greatest commandments to love our God and our neighbor as ourselves to be Good Christians.(They misunderstand what that means) So he asks how can a religion like that protect his family and control a man like himself? Only Islam can do that. I can see why he has gone that direction. The sad thing is that has its own horrible consequences he will find. Christianity is not what it should be. But neither is Islam what he thinks it is. And he will find that out. It is based in power and control and its own morality and code of conduct that people are required by force to adhere to and that fits his personality like a glove. He's gone from power and control to do what he wants to power and control to force himself and others to behave with a code of morality forcefully imposed upon them and in the current climate he sees that as being profoundly needed to turn this nightmare ship around before it swollows himself and his family up in it. But if only he knew the truth. If only Christianity as a whole knew the truth. Christianity in its pure form is the most amazing thing this world has ever seen. I pray for the day when as a whole we return to it. It will be a whole different world. Jesus is coming to right this ship! This time He is coming with a sword as the Jews were expecting the first time. And Islam is diametrically opposed to what He is will do. They are a counterfeit. We will see that a lot more in the near future. I pray he opens his eyes. I don't know that he will. But things are getting bad enough that it is forcing people to choose a side. The middle ground is fast disappearing. This is all going to get a lot worse before it gets better. But Jesus is coming! The amazing and complex yet simple beauty of true Christianity will turn this world into a beacon of beauty,  peace and light that we can't even comprehend yet. Sadly Islam will bathe it in blood first. And not just Islam. The Adversary has many coalitions that serve him,  including forms of Christianity that have been high jacked. He's pulling out all the stops in these last days and many of his groups will turn on eachother in the end. God is aware of all this and has been putting all His people and plans into place.

It has nothing to do with religion, it’s just plain brutal honesty and decency. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with telling it like it is. Same with Tate. In this interview he has taken full responsibility for his actions, past and present. We all need to be honest with ourselves and others and just be decent. What’s so hard about that?

Everything that's happening now regarding the recent interviews with Andrew Tate is called damage control and self preservation. His freedom is on the line because of the illegal activities he's done in the past and most recently. Just months before he was taken to jail Andrew Tate was on the Nelk's podcast talking about how he did not feel bad for scamming men out of their money or pushing women he specifically sought to have a relationship with into doing OnlyFans and sex work. And yet, he talks about masculinity as if he knows what it's all about while his women are in the room next door posting nudes and sex tapes on OF for people to buy so they can line his pockets.

I love it\",\"Here’s my 2 cents. \\n\\nI’m a Christian first. Everything else is a distant 98th place. When I listen to this man talk, it is immediately obvious that he is proud. And not in the good way. \\nJames 4:6 says that God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble. \\nAndrew Tate is someone whom God resists. As a side note: so is Donald Trump. Both are too proud to be godly leaders. \\n\\nSecond point is that he says very early into the interview that he’s not sorry about running the pornography business. He even said he doesn’t think it was wrong. That should tell you all you need to know about his seared conscious. \\nIf he really wanted to help young men, he wouldn’t add fuel to the number 1 method of spiritual warfare that is leveled at men: lust and pornography. \\n\\nI don’t really care about the legal case against Tate. He’s spiritually dead and should not be looked up to or listened to by believers. Don’t listen to someone whine the Lord resista\",\"I'm a conservative conservative. And i cringe at Tate's bravado and the distasteful things he said in his youth,  and the Islam, but i think Tate is trying to be a \\\"good person\\\", he's very intelligent and i love listening to him speak ❤\",\"The Tates literally were pimps, that's how they made their money to begin with. Andrew even bragged about scamming desperate men through his webcam business. Now, theyre scamming desperate young men again through a new online business.\\n\\nIt blows my mind that people don't see this. It couldn't be any more obvious.\",\"haha. The arrogance of this guy... Andrew Tate taught young people how to brutalize women, and he's using the Spartans to justify this wrong behavior. Look how pathetic he is in this interview, trying to double down on his unmanly charade.  Don't get confused and distracted by this weak man, who obviously is starting to fall apart and who is gradually losing his sanity because of humiliation and guilt after being cancelled by the few people who have the courage to suppress a scumbag. He's a piece of sh#t acting like an entitled little punk. Even the people of the \\\"The Sopranos\\\" realized the influence of their show, and did the right thing. And Candace also is just losing her purpose in life by supporting this clown. We are intelligent and good people. We see things clearly and we know the difference between right and wrong and know what to do. I would kick box Tate's stupid mouth if I was Candace.\",\"What’s so crazy is that-speaking from a Christian perspective,- Andrew Tate is very correct with the Islamic faith. it’s not the Christianity itself that’s falling , but it’s the Christians themselves that are giving in to the new rhetoric and agenda the liberalists are pushing. Christians today don’t seem to be fighting for their values and their beliefs. Whereas in the Middle East, any source of misinformation that does not coincide with their religion is not tolerated and you can be killed by even having the audacity to push any sort of demonic agenda. Tate seems to have an extremist spirit, one can honestly see why he would choose this faith, because there’s no in between for him, it’s either fully clothe your decent wives or half naked wives aren’t decent, which is theoretically correct, Christian’s would debate the need for hijabs and abayas, which is also not incorrect, but now, with this new era of naked women everywhere on the streets of America and on Instagram, some Christians wish we had a rule that would clothe women, because it goes back to the point that humans tend to keep taking things further than what their supposed to be. On the other hand, Candace is very comfortable in her faith, and unfortunately , to reach this level of comfortability, you have to be a strong believer, especially when the world is crumbling apart before your eyes, and it’s very hard as Christians, to stand up for your beliefs in todays society when standing up for your faith and your beliefs will lead to character assassination or persecution, which many Christians who are not strong in their faith, fear.\",\"You gotta love Andrew Tate because he is so fricken honest.

Keep your wits about you conservatives, this man may have neen wronged by the legal system but he is not the voice of our young generation. He is immoral, not just 10 years ago but now. \\n\\nAlso does anyone think he was misprouncing her name on purpose as a power play?\",\"Tate beat a woman & raped her, then texted her after the he loved raping her, a video of him attacking her surfaced, & he was kicked off big brother UK for it.  Then he sits there and claims he never hurt anyone?  That just shows his arrogance.  He has multiple female accusers that say all say the same thing, he beat and raped them.\",\"Both of you all please never stop.

But it just demonstrates don’t believe that snap shot media crap and that you don’t know someone till you actually invest a reasonable amount of time in them. I don’t agree with him on an everything , I’m sure he respects that but, I do believe he adds value to the world.\",\"Who is this dude that’s not the Tate I see everywhere on TikTok insta and such…he actually is capable of non-redpill behavior\\u002fconversations\",\"After Tate's pro-palestine comments on Twitter the Daily Wire won't bring him back on.

This interview contradicted most of the criticism I’ve heard of him, and allowed him to express his opinions fully in a way that is beneficial to the conversation and listeners, whether they agree with his views or not. Thank you!\",\"Let's be real. None of this matters whatsoever. Tate is one person out of 8 billion. I'm not fortunate i'm not against tate i'm not four owens i'm not against owens. I just think we care about the dumbest things these days. I mean, there is a plethora of things going on in 2023 the united states that are far worse than anything one person has done or is doing. The truth will always come out. So in all reality, there's no reason to judge or really give a shit about any of this.\",\"I think this interview sheds light on the real Andrew tate…hes vocal…smart…assertive…and freaking handsome!\",\"A lot of satanic hand gestures there, Tate. And I'm only a couple minutes in.\",\"Mass r watching bcz of Tate ... real top G...\",\"Ok...I'm not a Tate fan due to the abusive patriarchy he pushes. But, I am open minded, I will listen\\u002fwatch. If I'm wrong, I'm willing to admit it. ❤\",\"For a first time you can see a vulnerable tate in his speech. I tell you every beautiful woman has a charm to humble even a beast i mean literally\",\"He \\\"organized 'some' accounts on the internet\\\" is what he admits to doing. He was flat out lying and manipulating men in order to get their money and you did not care what effect it might have on them. He says he found a \\\"gap in the market\\\", but really all he has is a gap in morals. Andrew Tate will look for gaps in a system and exploit it and will not use any sense of morals, only opportunistic behavior to guide his decision making.\",\"How many times did Tate need to say: \\\"I'm one of the most famous people in the world\\\" - or - \\\" I think most people don't understand that...\\\"  and he has \\\"FORTY-TWO nice cars\\\" [emphasis by Tate].  --\\u003e\\u003e\\u003e\\u003e\\u003e\\u003e\\u003e. Sooooo many of his comments seem to point to his feelings of self-importance.   He appears (to me) to have many narcissistic traits, and I'm not a fan (EDIT: KEEP READING, this is just an introductory statement...I promise I'm not bashing him for this interview).\\n\\nThat said, I appreciate this interview because it seems to put into context the various social media content that Tate historically put out. The \\\"peacocking\\\" that young men feel the need to pursue these days is truly a sad testament to how low society has gotten. It is a shame that men, or rather people in general, can't just be themselves and feel pride for having done a good days work of being a productive member of society, in whatever work they choose or fall in to.  I don't know what the truth is about Tate's situation in Romania, but if he and his brother were truly guilty of this alleged kidnapping and human trafficking, I doubt that Romania would have released them from jail. I do remember, however, that Tate himself said on a video that the reason he CHOSE Romania to live and work in, was because of how easy it was to bribe officials to get away with things, so that does leave me with a huge question mark.\\n\\nAs always, I suspect that the truth lies somewhere between what is being portrayed by media, and what Tate himself says. I agree with Candace that I also am relieved to hear that Tate is a bit embarrassed about the brash videos he made as a younger man. People make mistakes, people grow and evolve as human beings. Despite what I perceive as Tate's narcissistic personality, still no reason for false allegations and charges or cancel culture. If people want to follow Tate's videos, even if they seem misogynistic, if he's not hurting anyone, then allowing people to choose what to watch or imitate is part of the human experience.  Even the Christian God made a point to give humans free will. \\n\\nThe viewpoint that Candace has that boys are boys and girls are girls, and how social media is just stupid but fun content and shouldn't be taken so seriously is on point. I appreciate that Tate himself calls most of his videos (at least from the past) bravado. One of the comments I really liked from Tate was when he was talking about not watching videos that attack him -- because he doesn't know or respect certain critics enough to be bothered because he doesn't care and he's too busy. (Though I'm gonna push back on that comment because if that's the case, why did he respond to Greta Thunberg's video? ). Overall that's a good way to watch social media - if you don't respect the person or like the person that's making the video, don't watch it, because it doesn't add value to your life. If some video makes you angry, just move on - why put that kind of negativity in your life? \\n\\nTate did say something I found to be really valuable - that one must be financially secure to push back against societal or governmental ills that one does not agree with. If you don't have money, you are beholden to that paycheck, so must continue to do things you may not like or agree with.  That was a golden comment. Its easy for people to say that if you believe something is wrong you have to stand up against it - but if you have bills to pay and a family to care for, you just don't have that luxury. Hence wealth is very important (as Tate says) in that it actually allows you to stand up for your principles. Otherwise, you are beholden to whoever pays your wages.  THIS is a message that Tate should put on all his videos - like a scrolling message at the bottom of his clips.  \\n\\nBottom line: people who don't like Tate, or any other social media influencer (*cough* Kardashians) can choose to NOT watch these videos\\u002fshows. \\n\\nI watched this particular interview because I find value in some of the viewpoints that Candace Owens shares. I do appreciate that this is one of those rare times when Andrew Tate seemed to be allowed to defend himself and explain his history on social media, without fingers pointing in his face or negative feedback, allowing him to perhaps be more willing to say things that are more truthful than he normally might be allowed. Whether I agree with any of the points made is irrelevant. This was a good interview.\",\"Andrew tate, my favourite person in the planet, so glad to see him doing well and being okay, I was so sad when all the media was filled with bullshit about he being captured etc… so is refreshing and uplifting to see him looking great and in perfect condition, so so happy.

Such a horrible influence.\",\"Love Tate\",\"Candace you have stood up bravely on many causes from cov$d shots, to child vaccines, to BLack lives matter.... but being on Andrew Tates side is one thing that you are not correct on. His previous interviews show him explaining how he recruits girls. Speaks about them in a very degrading and sexual manner. He is unapologetic about using them to make money. Amongst many other horrific things he has claimed. He is not someone that men should aspire to be like. Does he make some valid points, yes. But overall he is not the definition of a balanced, moral, and healthy individual. \\nDefending somone like him is very concerning.

I'm not a fan of his \\\"top g\\\" classes. I think he's found a market of young boys that are looking for a male role model and Tate portrays himself as one pretty well. He's making money filling in for fatherless young men and having them pay for his classes on how to be a man. I was a fan but as I find out more of his past, and present I find myself less of a fan. Especially when he got out of jail recently and \\\"pranked\\\" an interviewer for writing a bad piece on him or something. For me, if that were me I wouldn't waste time on such a trivial thing as revenge on a POS journalist. In that video he came off more as a bully as I see it. That was definitely not top G to me 😂. \\n\\nYes I know I'm flawed too but in my eyes that's what I see, him playing a role to make money as an influencer, top G professor.\",\"Every signal time I say I want to be Andrew Tate I’m blocked.\",\"My first impression of Mr Andrew Tate was from the clips of cut out interviews to make him look bad.

Since you want to portray Tate like Jesus I hope you’re ready to endorse that behavior\",\"I had never watched an interview Candice Owens conducted until tonight. She is a very good interviewer and definitely shows Tate isn’t the misogynistic toxically masculine monster the media portrays him to be.

No, Tate has self-admitted to still webcamming as early as 2 years ago. He also lied about never selling drugs - he has admitted to selling drugs on camera as well.

My advice would be whatever you believe in, just tell your god how bad you feel and how mean the world is with you and ask him to help, and then take all the weight you were carrying and give it to your god and stand up you will feel released and will start to find solutions.

I do agree that people can change but i dont think he has.\",\"Both Tate and Owens are really the same resultant cultural phenomenon. Role models of the Information age, arising from the convergence of the collapse of morality and the rise of the prominence of the political state. They are explosive figures, who I happen to believe are prophetic voices in a decaying social order that is dooming the next generation to a life without ultimate meaning. In this sense, I’m encouraged that we can turn around a crashing society. They can be the leaders of a rational spiritual renaissance.

There are aspects to him that people want, like his luck, his assertiveness, or his persuasion, but majority of his personality traits are either laughable or disadvantageous. Men like Jordan Peterson or JWaller tend to give more practical, and useful advice. They don't care about preying on the insecurities and resentment of young men like Tate does. They don't seek to abscond from and deny their wrongdoings, or to view the world as a fantasy where they somehow are the main character. Tate's a delusional narcissist who is only excused by luck and the wealth he's made off exploiting young men and women. He's disliked by left wingers for obvious reasons, and he's praised by right wingers for his contradiction and dissent from left views. What's really funny is that so many don't realize how unwell he is.\",\"There's such a disconnect between what Andrew Tate is saying about being responsible, independant, caring about things in the world, and the way he acts flaunting cars, talking about women as conquests and being physically confrontational, it just reeks of insecurity.\",\"Andrew Tate is a compulsive liar for example he said he hasn’t had any involvement in webcam business for 9 years but he himself said he’s still involved in it as recent as 2020\",\"Who else noticed tates hard nips?\",\"Tate enjoyed this conversation.

When he says, \\\"I didn't hurt anybody\\\" rings shallow as I have been hurt by such behaviors both emotionally and financially. If he does not address his contribution to his former client's victims, he is either ignorant of the harm that was caused by his business or uncaring about it.\",\"Some great content, do you think Andrew Tate has changed since he first became famous? or is it because he has been to jail?\",\"2:27:00 - Honestly, I know the women (from Youtube) referred by Candace (Allie Stuckey and Liz Wheeler), and that they're conservatives. Nothing Tate has expressed here can be disputed or criticized. He's FAR more effective than EITHER of those women at teaching GOOD principles to a hell of a lot more people than they are. Time to shut up, and take notice. That's called humility. I'm NOT INTERESTED in their bitching points (because, honestly, that's what it feels like at this point - like the \\\"experts\\\" who always get it wrong). Honestly, they couldn't have done their homework, and that THEIR problem, not Tate's. To bring it up in the first place is foolishness.

He stood up against such a influential and probably one of the most powerful families in our history. He did it to protect and honour his wife. You don’t get more masculine than that. He saw what the media and the lack of support from his ‘family’ did to his mother, he protected his family from that. That’s a sign of a strong and not a weak man. \\n\\nA man biggest strength is to know his own weakness.\\n\\nI don’t think the issue with our society is that men have been encouraged to express emotion more. I think the problem with our society is not encouraging women to accept men with a strong and emotional side. Both can exist in a person and it don’t make them weak or strong. It can be a fine balanced person with both types of traits.\",\"I have liked Andrew Tate for several years now, and as a woman I have been persecuted not only from other women, but from men as well but now you sit down and listen to him speak which this is how he has spoken as long as I’ve listen to him he may be a little bit arrogant yes but he’s very smart.

I’ve been your fan Candace since the first time you were on YouTube, and I’ve been a fan of Andrews now for about six months, my son who is now 35 years old really looks up to Andrew Tate, he was surprised that I knew who ANDREW was. I never did ask him where he seen ANDREW at anyway I’ve seen a big change in Andrew Tate since the first interview I seen of him he’s a strong man I know he’s a Allicin male I think that’s what they call him, anyway I’m a big fan of both of yours amazing fantastic thank you so much\",\"The fact that Tate is one of the most hated humans on the planet and they are trying to stop him shows how evil the world has become.

Maybe he is a psycho path or narcissist?  Not saying he is but why wud a person join a Tom fool religion that was copied from Judaism and Christianity . Why not join the original  religion .. maybe u can make an excuse for it but it’s hard to except that a smart person wud join a religion who wears robes and wraps grain sacks around  their heads and b_*^gs  goats and and camels and claims to be bright? And says that the web cam business is better then selling drugs . But honestly I don’t hate Tate he blasts truth bombs and the elites hate him . So.. in my estimation he can’t be all bad\",\"As a muslim, I really respect and appreciate how Andrew Tate is not directly looking at Candance but chooses to honour her by averting direct eye contact.\",\"I’m glad Candace pointed out Tate’s changes!

You should be ashamed of yourself for liking such conversation! \\n\\nI even blocked that woman from TikTok so I don’t see her face and listen to her, but this podcast came to me while I was working. \\n\\nWhy? Because she is the most judgimental person I have seen, she is judging so many people, but when it comes to Tate “she understands that he has grown”? Or she is shit scared to not disagree with him, because knowing him probably he would have spoken to her with disrespect in her own show if she dared to disagree\\n\\nAnd she is supporting his toxic masculinity. I’d like to see her ass being in a marriage with someone like him so then she can speak. \\n\\nTalking about being secure for the first time in her life - she can never be secure with emotionally unavailable, broken man who has seen emotional distance from his dad since he was child. And raising children with such man is probably Hell. \\n\\nThe way he speaks about his dad being the hero and his mum \\u002fwho has even left her relationship, because she realized her kids are mistreated\\u002f is just someone who cooked for them and dressed them up. \\n\\nI’d like to see her living and raising kids with such man, she wouldn’t have survived. \\n\\nAnd don’t get me started on the Islam, because he is in haram even talking about women the way he is!!! He is so fake, probably converted to get more following, but true muslim people will see through his BS\\n\\nSo why is she agreeing with him? I thought she is outside the “Matrix” \\n\\nNo she is not, because she is still a woman and his toxic masculinity is frightening and he will tell her off in front of everyone and she is affraid of that. \\n\\nI thought she is ever so brave, no she is brave to judge people only behind the screen, but face to face she is quiet as a lamb. \\n\\nThere are many more successful, wise, grounded men like Lewis Howes, Jay Shetty, Steven Bartler, Timothy Sykes etc etc who probably have more money than this dude and set A GOOD, HEALTHY EXAMPLE. \\n\\nNo, secure man won’t show cars and earn respect that way! He doesn’t give a s**t about such things. \\n\\nInsecure people “flash” their wealth. True wealth and class does not do that! \\n\\nYou know why- because they take pride in their purpose and serving people, they talk about mental health. Not this dude… \\n\\nIn one of his interviews he said “I care about young men’s mental health” and now he says “I don’t care what you are feeling” \\n\\nIf that was the case - men wouldn’t commit suiscide more than women at this point. Every person has to be heard! \\n\\nI have seen examples of wealthy men who respect their wives and treat them like queens, have healthy, happy kids and drive the same car for 10 years, but living in 3,000,000£ house and having the best of the best experiences, holidays, food etc \\n\\nAnd I have men who flash their “wealth”, because they are insecure AF, grew up poor and now they want to show they made it, but inside the house they are broke, having taken loans to afford the watches, the cars, etc etc \\n\\nAbout the point about Prince Harry- he is the good example, I’d like to see Candace being disrespected by her in laws and her husband saying “That is what it is, so shut up” like Mr Tate suggested. And how his father Kind Charles handled his marriage, how did that end? \\n\\nWhy would you take disrespect from your own family, disrespecting your partner is directly disrespecting you and your choice. And the media in the UK was tarnishing his wife like crazy. Every good husband is PROTECTOR! He protected her and their family. \\n\\nHow do you know if they are unhappy? How do you know if they are fighting or not? \\n\\nSo the next time you hear any of those two people talk take the information with a grain of salt, because both are full of BS. \\n\\nI see his success - being in jail, under house arrest, single and having children from different women. And that is an example of great life in his eyes …….But he is the “big G” “the man” .. not like Prince Harry, married with two children, right .:\",\"One of the best interviews\\u002fconversations I've listened to with Mr. Tate.

Teaching young minds to be leaders and not follows should be the important thing to have such a platform . Mrs. Owen's you have such an amazing platform and I am happy that you show young women how to be a strong minded women or young lady to be a person with good qualities and showing young ladies that God is present in your life. I don't consider myself as a Christian,  I feel the true story should be to follow the foot steps that Jesus as made for all of us to follow. Jesus is definitely in my life . God bless us all to be good and treat others with compassion and not judge one other of their faults in life . God Bless everyone!!\",\"Andrew Tate is a master manipulator.

I even defended Tate to people based on Candace's interview, because I respect her values & intellect. Sadly she did not do her research into Tate's background very well. Very disappointing. 🤔😡\",\"What did Tate do for money?????????!!!!!!!!!!! Never forget he uses women for money\",\"When Candace asked him about his relationship with his mother… There it is. His hesitancy to answer the question as he stumbles upon his words, trying to find the right thing to say. Andrew Tate has mommy issues. Perhaps resentment towards her for leaving his father and moving so far away from him. People don’t like to talk about Mommy issues because they feel like there’s a sense of disrespect because the woman goes through so much in giving birth to the child. There’s a lot behind that. As I’m slowly learning myself in my own relationship with my mother. I agree with Candace and Tate talk about how the mental health scene can get exploited in allows people to think that they are the victim in the story that they tell themselves. But I think that maybe Andrew could benefit from therapy. Candace talk about when she had an eating disorder and she went to lots of therapy. So don’t knock it till you try it.\",\"Who are in support of ANDREW TATE 🔥\",\"Wow wow wow Candace Owen's gaslighting her audience on behalf of this con artist.\\n\\nThis interview is gonna age like milk  when the Tate bros get put away for a looooooong time.\",\"I am woman.

She finally gets and opportunity to be able to speak with Andrew Tate himself and literally spends 3 hours kissing his ass, not know a goddamn thing about what he’s been charged with or accused of, and uses it as an opportunity to attack the left and state her own political views.

But one part of this video that is still not convincing to me is, the videoclip shown at 1:55:01. Which he later explains this is a clip that \\\"describes how running a webcam business can affect his dating life\\\", but in fact it was a part of material where he teaches \\\"how to manage a webcam business by maintaining sexual relationships with multiple women that initially came to him with the willingness to do webcam business\\\". There's a slight difference, I think he's being dodgy here, but still it's not as criminal as seducing women who are romantically interested in him and use them for pornographic webcam business, aka the \\\"Loverboy method\\\".\",\"Ok this version of Andrew Tate is actually alright ngl\",\"Andrew Tate is an organized criminal like an octopus with his dirty finger in every crime pie there is. Oh and the tip of his iceberg is about to be exposed for his disgusting web of crimes.

Your a Fraud\",\"Best interview  this is my 2time watching it love it \\nP.s. Andrew Tate is Fine Asf 😋\",\"Why do all the interviewers of Tate (including Candice, Tucker and Patrick) all omit to question him on his cruel manipulation methods  of women. Here is an excerpt from a Rolling Stone article (with authenticated war room messages) where Andrew teaches his followers various ways on how to manipulate women to get them to work for them on onlyfans \\n\\\"In the messages, Tate explained how one of the women, who moved from her native country to be with him and has “lost her support networks at home,” had been begging to see him. So in order to make her more dependent on him, he writes, he made up a story that he had spoken to friends of hers who had claimed she had worked at a sex club prior to meeting him, prompting him to become angry at her and threaten to kick her out. In the texts, Tate appears to explain how this lie succeeds in putting the woman on the defensive and making her more dependent on him.\\\" He goes on to say \\\"“The real goal is for her to agree to never go anywhere without me. Not even her home town,” he writes. “I need her working.”......Tate is not the suave funny guy that comes across in these interviews...the real Tate had no qualms about  being  cruel and manipulative with young women to further his sad quest for money. \\n.....\",\"Why didn’t u include more of the candace owens interview? I haven’t watched it but i bet it was more context to this. Fucking tate haters man😂\",\"2:38:25\\nThat's the whole idea behind Andrew Tate beliefs\",\"Many Christian men listen to this person. The things Andrew Tate values are money cars beautiful women, that is what he considers being a success and being a man. I heard nothing of charity kindness humility or love. Sure, do your best in life and be disciplined, but the things he values are absolutely not Biblical, as Christians are taught to build up their treasure in heaven. If you aren’t Christian this comment isn’t for you.\",\"Wasn't those 7 men, who she supposedly used and ruined, were adult child predators, while she was under age?\\n\\nTate talks about slave mind, believing everything you see on tv and internet, brainwashing...\\nYet he does the same thing.\\nAnd he now has an army of brainwashed minions.\\n\\nHe says and does good things.\\nBut it all might be a facade to get people on his side. Maybe im wrong. Truth always comes to the light.\\n\\nBut you must be awfully naive to believe in someone 100%.\",\"Please get Tate a book\",\"Such a great interview. Both Owens and Tate are so insightful and make you think about your own situations. There are so many topics I can agree with.\\nIm not a huge Tate fan, but I truly think he's a good and genuine person who understands how the world operates. And for people to try to shut him down is a shame.\",\"I just wonder if all the naysayers, even those that follow Candace and Dailywire, after watching this entire video can say they don't have a slight adjustment in opinion on Tate. The reason young men gravitate towards him so much is because they are hungry for masculine leadership and the media is purposely trying to shut it out. He is SO IMPORTANT! Thank u Candace for giving him a platform to speak to an audience who otherwise wouldn't listen to a full sit down & is otherwise getting their bias from woke media with a blatantly obvious agenda to snuff out Tate & and those that sound like him. This wasn't even an interview. This was a BRILLIANT conversation\",\"I'm so sorry to say this - I mean it cos I love Candace's work -, but based on Andrew Tate's own words - not taken out of context and easily found on the internet - Tate used sex to make women to obey him to make him money. And this is put very mildly. Is this really something we can stand by? I'm saddest about how this interview basically supports Tate. Guilty or not of the actual charges - I have no idea. That's not my point. But his own words condemn him to such a degree that there is NO WAY an even remotely decent person should use his or her platform to defend him. Especially not Candace who has deservedly earned our respect with her integrity. I still support and love Candace, but I think this one missed.\",\"Tate should never speak about morality.

So your father would be proud of that and that is a respectable career that wouldn't bring shame to your family name ?\",\"@realcandaceo please, please take this down… I was totally supportive of your video, and then I dug. No manipulation - simply his voluntary words and his interviews. Please watch for instance: JORDAN PETERSON CALLS TATE SCUM AS OLD FOOTAGE OF TATE RESURFACED CONSERVATIVES TURNING ON REDPILL. Just one compilation but my goodness… the full interviews. He did not accept accountability in this interview and attempted to change the narrative. Had he owned up to his previous viewpoint and apologized, then cool. But in this, he did not. He admitted to the mindset: “get women to fall in love with me and (coerce) them to get on my webcam”… Candace. Candace.\",\"showing off isnt something that is good tbh . absolutely wrong there. \\n\\nbut at the same time. being sorry for who you are. no . absolutely right there.\\n\\nhence .  i say , Tate needs to keep learning. and i hope he is smart enough to know that , when a person stops learning, his\\u002fher decline starts.\",\"@RealCandaceO I remember when you did the video about Steven Crowder when the video leaked of him berating his pregnant wife. You were merciless with your words regarding him, yet with Tate you basically gave him a 3 hour platform where he waters down his so called “past” actions. He is not sorry for anything. If you cannot say that you would be ok with Andrew Tate dating your own daughter then maybe you should be careful how you allow your influence to portray him. I’ve loved your show for years but this did it in for me. I canceled my DW subscription. I am a very traditional wife and have staunch values, but I do not believe that Tate is a good man. He is not a man that boys and men should strive to be. I would never want my daughters in a relationship with Tate or someone of the like. We need traditional values and traditional marriages so that society can once again flourish.\",\"Thank you, Candace, for this interview!! I'm a 56 yrs. old female,  and  I have more respect for Andrew Tate now. He is truly a gentleman and honestly speaks his belief.

The media quickly shut him up as best they could. He seemed quite intelligent from the little I heard. I never felt offended as a woman. I didn’t know a lot about him and then all I saw for a while was horrible things people were saying he was involved in. I didn’t look into it  because I know the media lies. Now watching this whole interview I see he’s clearly intelligent. Even though he’s not someone I would look up to as an example for marriage, doesn’t change the fact he is an intelligent guy. Not perfect but not brainwashed. He has flaws just like everyone else that will always be magnified due to his fame. I find him interesting and I like to listen to what interesting people have to say. Doesn’t mean he’s an idol or anything else. But I’m glad to hear his side on the charges. Hopefully one day Candace realizes it’s okay to respect others religious beliefs and that not everyone has to be a Christian for us to live in harmony. It’s great he found his spiritual path and connection to god.\",\"First time I see tate somewhat intimidated, all God!!!\",\"So disingenuous of him to say that what he did wasn't that bad.  He exploited girls and coached other men to exploit girls too.  I've seen the videos, it's horrifying how he talks about women in those.  He's still trying to come out of it like it was nothing and he did nothing wrong, EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES, own it up Tate.  THEN move on.\",\"Non of Tate's interviews  are the same. There is always something new to learn from him.\\n\\nI also appreciate the moderation of Candace. She didn't have to feel so sorry for his conversion to Islam, specially that she admitted knowing nothing about the religion. \\n\\nI find what the \\\"atheist\\\" Andrew tate did 10 years ago was simply being an atheist living as an Atheist. \\n\\nIn fact, I don't see what he did being worst than the porn and sexual materials that Hollywood produces and gets publicly celebrated and awarded.

I am even more shocked that Candace Ownes whom I highly respect even interviewed him. All you need to do is listen to his past comments to understand that this man is vile. He is a scam artist and an abuser of women with no respect for them. He has admitted to being a pimp and is proud of it. He thinks women are stupid and because they are he can control them. I am disgusted by not only Candace having him on her show, but by so many people that seem to like him. This low life needs to spend the rest of his life in prison. It is heartbreaking that Candance does not see through his lies and his blatant hate for women.\",\"If Tate cannot say he was wrong for grooming women to take their virginity (which he is on camera admittinghe did), He is nothing to me.

He just a honest guy .\",\"There are nearly 2 billion Muslims worldwide. Tate is a Muslim. Candace knew very little if anything about Islam but yet interviewed Tate. Surely some research should have been done. His mindset and way of thinking would definitely have been more informative\",\"Shining a light on Andrew Tate reveals a figure who thrives on controversy and self-aggrandizement. His attempts to gain attention through offensive and derogatory comments about women display a lack of empathy and understanding. Tate's glorification of materialism and traditional gender roles echoes outdated ideals, dismissing the complexities of modern relationships and individual aspirations. While he presents himself as a voice of authority, his shallow perspectives and superficial values diminish the credibility of his opinions. His behavior reflects a troubling blend of narcissism and a desperate need for validation, often at the expense of degrading others. It's essential to critically examine his views and consider the harm they perpetuate, rather than granting him the unwarranted attention he seeks.\",\"Andrew Tate's behaviors and public statements often exhibit qualities that are associated with an inflated self-image and narcissistic personality traits:\\n\\nGrandiosity: Tate frequently portrays himself as highly successful, intelligent, and superior to others. He often brags about his achievements and material possessions, showcasing a grandiose self-image.\\nEntitlement: He tends to believe he is entitled to special treatment, admiration, and recognition, indicating a sense of entitlement commonly seen in narcissistic individuals.\\nLack of Empathy: Tate's statements and attitudes can display a lack of genuine empathy for others. He may dismiss the struggles or concerns of people who don't share his viewpoints, a common trait in narcissism.\\nAttention-Seeking: His controversial statements and provocative behavior suggest a desire for attention and notoriety, which is consistent with narcissistic individuals' need for constant admiration.\\nManipulative Behavior: Tate's communication style often involves trying to persuade or manipulate his audience, aiming to shape their perceptions according to his perspective—a behavior that aligns with narcissistic tendencies.\\nDismissal of Criticism: He often reacts defensively to criticism, dismissing detractors as envious or misguided. This reflects a typical response of narcissistic individuals who struggle to accept criticism.\\nIdealization and Devaluation: Tate sometimes idealizes certain traits, like wealth or assertiveness, and devalues those who don't align with his ideals, showcasing black-and-white thinking often found in narcissism.\\nSuperiority Complex: His belief in his inherent superiority and the idea that he possesses unique knowledge or insight can be seen as a manifestation of a superiority complex common among narcissistic personalities.\",\"Andrew Tate really really really nice guy❤\",\"we need a Tate , 19Keys , & Billy Carson cipher  just saying.\",\"Tate is a fuckin proxo, raper, islamist.

He used to be very open about it before he started courting conservatives. He denigrates men who look at Porn while also selling it to them. Candace is immature and therefore starry eyed by the celebrity status of this interview. She and Tate are also strangely alike. The narcissism that they both appear to struggle with is striking in this interview...ie. let's talk about how much wiser we are than everyone else. She was literally simping for him.

I can't understand why Jordan Peterson is attacking him. It seems like they are saying similar things.  It could be he is reacting to these 10 year old videos they were talking about.  If so, Peterson should be more careful. If you call someone a pimp, you could get sued for a lot of money. Peterson should interview him and be as tough as he wants to be and let Tate explain himself as he did here. The left seems to be crowing as if they tricked Peterson into calling Tate a pimp.

I'm a big fan of Candice's, but this was not good. Without saying outright that he's guilty, I will say he most likely did the things he's being charged with. There seems to be insurmountable video evidence for it. He's recorded video after video after video of everything he did and how proud of all of it he was.

Whether he has changed or not. Perhaps ask the Quran what it says about taking advantage of people. Or even lying.\",\"Yes, Tate has some very positive messages, as well as an abhorrent past.  The problem is, Tate is egotistical, narcissistic, and admittedly is NOT sorry for any of his past, and thinks he did nothing wrong.  He is on camera admitting to manipulating women, getting them to fall in love with him, then coercing them to prostitute their bodies to enrich himself. He admitted doing this, and as little as 3 years ago, on a live stream admitted he STILL had 3  women working for him.  This is LITERALLY the definition of human sex trafficking.  And again, does not think he did ANYTHING wrong and is not sorry for any of it.  It can and has been proven that in this Candace Owens interview, he lied several times, and Candace NEVER pushed back.   Tate is NOT propped up by God but by satan.  Remember! In scripture, satan can transform himself into an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:14).   The devil NEVER shows up as something blatantly evil, but as something that appears good.  Look deeper!  Once Tate repents of exploiting women as he has, then I'll consider him a good force in the world.  Also, he worships the wrong god, the false god Allah.  Keep in mind he thinks he did nothing wrong just because he never killed anyone.  ANYONE who can't admit wrong, or apologize, I stay away from. Including Trump!  Follow Jesus Christ, not man.  He can preach about taking care of your body, not watching porn, and paying your bills all he wants.  But if he's NOT sorry for exploiting women, NOT preaching Jesus, and doesn't believe in salvation by faith in Christ and becoming Christlike, then what's the point???  \\\"For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul\\\"  (Mark 8:36).  Being conservative does not equal salvation through Christ.  If you are NOT pointing people to eternal life, and you are ultra materialistic, what are you doing that will have a lasting effect???  Candace, I pray you repent for siding with this man who has absolutely NO remorse whatsoever for what he's done. I'm praying for you and Tate.\",\"I am new to your channel, and I have subscribed. I really enjoyed this interview. I was already an Andrew Tate fan. Thank you for this.\",\"Why won’t any of the right leaning hosts ask him point blank period about the recordings & messages where he’s straight up talking about tricking women in thinking he’s in love with them, in order to get them to sell themselves on the internet? Or where he would confiscate their passports? It’s kinda wild how hypocritical some conservatives are. Ofc Tate is being targeted, ofc the establishment is against him but why not actually call him out on the fd up stuff he’s done, ESPECIALLY after he says he has no regrets & everyone he worked with loves him?\",\"This is completely RIDICULOUS! \\n\\nYeah, I'm not saying that Candice Owens is a bad person, but I am certainly saying that her saying that Andrew Tate is just trying to boys how to be men is asinine and really really backward. \\n\\nThis is very disheartening and disturbing.\",\"We got asinistic feminists in the comment section, calling Tate a liar. But whole governments havent found anything on him to convict him of anything but hes the liar???

He has matured and I am.. attracted?

I enjoyed this conversation.\",\"THEY GO AFTER TATE .. THEY GO AFTER TRUMP .. WAKE UP PEOPLE\",\"damn I didn’t know Tate was perspicacious\",\"I'm a 61 year old woman and I love Andrew Tate ❤\",\"How much did Tate pay you to make him look good? Theres SO many videos coming out of people telling the actual truth from JUST few years ago of him teaching men to lure unsuspecting women, have sex with them and have them work to scam men out of money. The \\\"lover boy\\\" method? The email of him making MILLIONS off these girls??? I was a HUGE advocate of you,  Candace, but this.... you should be ashamed of yourself and you lost all credibility. You look VERY different to me now, and I'm sure many others. If Biden or any leftist did the SICKENING shit Tate has done, you'd be ALL over it, demonizing them, but its Tate. So its ok if he trafficks women. The right will do fine without Tate. Don't let the fake integrity CLOUD your and everyone judgement. Please tell the truth and be the virtuous pro-life honorable woman we all thought you were...\\n\\nFor all of you reading this, please see the videos below with ACTUAL evidence about Tate and who he REALLY is and just how much Candace is lying to ALL of us:\\n\\nWhaddo you meme:  https:\\u002f\\u002fyoutu.be\\u002f-ec_gA-hBNM\\n\\nApostate Prophet: https:\\u002f\\u002fwww.youtube.com\\u002flive\\u002fTy7tATaLzJk?feature=share\\n\\nWarrior Poet Society:  https:\\u002f\\u002fyoutu.be\\u002fuLqCS0esFPE\\n\\nThe Authentic Observer: https:\\u002f\\u002fyoutu.be\\u002foUguE2TDCck\",\"ALL HAIL ANGREW TATE!!!

You, yourself Candace are exactly what the world needs as well. Thank you for giving him his voice and thank you for being who you are Candace.  You are both critical in the world today.  May the good guys prevail.\",\"Andrew Tate is talking the Truth but the matrix is trying to stop him\",\"Huh. I was extremely Anti-Tate but this video has changed my mind about a lot of his core beliefs, and I’m able to see a lot of growth. Thanks for doing this interview Candace.\",\"Candace Owens was not ok with how Kim Kardashian started her career.  The sex tape that was originated by Kris. Called Kim a prostitute and Kris a pimp.  This interview is such hypocrisy.  Andrew Tate is the master manipulator if he manipulated Owens.  He made his money off the backs of young girls which he lured in with his lover boy methods.  His indictment has countless of charges against him.  I can’t believe he is stupid enough to continue to do interviews and he totally contradicts everything he says and has said.  I never met a more stupid, ruthless man like Tate and Candace fell for his charms.  I wish I had seen the pit bull Candace in this interview.  I don’t even recognize this Candace.  Unfollowing and unsubscribing.\",\"Wish folks like Owen's and PBD were less Islamophobic. Are you all shtting bricks that tate is a muslim? Can't sleep at night can ya\",\"I’ve always loved Tate from the start. His message is important\",\"Tate 👍👍\",\"Andrew tate openly brags about scamming men and being a loverboy and webcam pimp exploiting young women. This was not 10 years ago like he claims in this interview, this was recently. He does not regret it and shows no redemption. He says it's OK because 1. He comes from a rough background and 2. \\\"Look what other bad people are doing\\\". Besides that, he is showcasing and a materialistic lifestyle. I wouldn't say Tate is a rolemodel for young men to look up to. She really lets him of the hook here, he is clearly telling a lot of lies that can be easily challenged which she doesn't..\",\"I don't understand why you are softening what Tate and his 'company' have done. I used to work with former trafficked women and the method Tate used in order to manipulate women into sexualizing themselves and making money - IS TRAFFICKING. There are many clips of Tate bragging about this accomplishment. Pretty disgusting that with your level of influence You would defend his (publicly bragged about) pimp standing. I hope you will re-examine his videos, where he explains what his company (PHD) was  all about.  I look forward to the proceedings and hope that justice will be  served because there's a lot of confusion and deception going on around this issue - now added to by yourself, Candice. It's important to send a message to men and women that USING AND MANIPULATING others for your own gain and wealth is wrong and can be illegal. I think your discernment is way off on this one.\",\"Candace, I agree with a lot of what you say. But it seems like you were already defensive of Tate before he started answering questions. Have you done your research? He lied to your face throughout the entire interview. Many of the clips you discuss were from more recently than ten years ago. And again and again, clip after clip, you will hear Tate describe the most obvious manipulation tactics used in human trafficking. Since when is manipulation and coercion not a part of the human trafficking definition? Nothing has changed. Its been that way for at least twenty years. He manipulated girls and he manipulated you.\\nBut more than that, you have contributed to setting up Tate as an influence for good by defending him the way you did. He is probably one of the worst role models for boys out there. Having sex with women to make money off of their blind devotion to Him. He claims he loves women, but his degrading of their bodies by manipulating them into doing shameless acts reveals his hatred for them. If he loved them, he would desire the best for them. As it is, he only acts for his self interests, and it comes across as though you don’t see a problem with this. Don’t you think that women are worth more than this?\\nAren’t you a Christian, Candace? Do not let politics blind you to the truth. Would you defend Tate if he were liberal? Why is he an icon to anyone? Just because he says some things that are true and frustrate the left does not mean his other ideas are not poisonous. They are. Surely you know that? Can you not see that he despises God by not owning up to his sin and by destroying that which is beautiful? He profanes God by treating women like products to sell and throw away once they’re all used up. \\nCandace, please make right this wrong by really investigating this guy. Forget being a republican or a conservative or right wing or whatever. Be a Christ follower if you are one.\",\"Love Andrew tate\",\"@RealCandaceO CANDACE YOU CAN BE HIS SISTER, BOTH MARRIED AND WORKER WOMENS, WHO Tate AND HIS BROTHER Tristan DEFINE AS Crappy Mothers JUST cause YOU NEED TO CHOOSE ONE🎉 WHY YOU DIDNT ASK ABOUT THAT. AND WHY HE HAVE TO MANY KIDS AND HOW ABOUT HIS DAUGHTERS, WHAT KIND OF MEN , HE WANTS FOR THEM. CAUSE HE LET MANY WOMEN SINGLE WITH KIDS. SO I GUESS HE DONT CARE ABOUT WOMEN FEELING AT ALL. THATS MY PROBLEM WITH Tate, HIS INJUSTICE AND HIPOCRITAL WAY. HE PRAISE CANDACE BUT SHE CLEARLY CAN BE HIS SISTER🎉 I HOPE YOU READ THIS @RealCandaceO\",\"I couldn’t stand Andrew Tate until recently. Seems like he has changed and I’m starting to have respect for him. There is one thing I would have loved for Candace to ask him is how he spoke about women. He was teaching men to date\\u002fmarry 20 year old’s because women in their 30’s and up have been through multiple men, come with lots of baggage and are too old after 35 to have kids. I was reading comments on those videos and it was so insulting to women my age.\",\"I like Tate, He sounds like his 1970's version of his British Grandfather when he speaks on Stoic men. He is right of course. Tight emotional control stops school shootings and dudes chopping off their junk off to compete against girls.\",\"Disgusted! Tate lied about being a changed man. There's video proof of two and three years ago talking about what he does to women. Candace should have done better research. Otherwise, she's ignoring the truth.\",\"Also need to add here that what we support meets up with our children. Think about the Kardashians. Remember their father let a type of man go.  Now they love men like that. You have boys would you prefer your son to grow into Tate. He deserves the same energy you put on George Floyd.\",\"Andrew Tate is a true con artist. To be able to fool so many conservatives into believing his lies is a great talent. There are so many videos of him stating his crimes. His ability to gaslight so many people is amazing.\",\"Nobody: …..\\n\\nMr. Tate: “If 30 full grown men decide to go into a room and be gay”\",\"Oh wow gosh Candace I have followed you for years now, but this is sad.  It shows you did not actually want to find the truth out about Tate or that you are consciously ignoring it for political reasons.  I'm going to assume you have missed it.  Just so a tiny bit of research.  Tate is lying about so many things in this video that have already been proven on video from as recent as a year ago.\\n\\nI hope to see you change your mind in this issue.  As Christians we have to stand for truth and point out evil when we see it.  Tate is evil. now yes there can be a transformational moment, but he can't seem to point to any transformational moment where she has actually changed. And if you're not sorry for the evil crimes that you've done in the past. , or even just evil acts, even if they're not a crime, then you're not transformed.\",\"Tate, you really lied to her face and she didn't know.\\nDo your research Candace Owens. Those statements were lies. \\nHow can he say he is not going to apologize to something he did in the past when he said he weaponize sex to make women attached to him and he used them for his business\",\"When I came across Andrew tate on internet, I just begin to smile.\",\"Did He say 10 Andrew Tates! I really want to see this\",\"You know, I used to be in the Tate brothers' corner, until I started watching some of their videos.  I'm totally on board with protecting the patriarchy....but not at the expense of  women.  The Tate bothers are lying through their teeth to save their own skins. Unfortunately,  Candace and Tucker* are falling for it  hook, line and sinker.  \\n\\n\\\"A changed man\\\"....I doubt it, it's the only way those two know how to make a living....using others as sex slaves!.....doesn't matter how you spin it!!\\n\\n[*watch Tuckers' interview with the other bro]\",\"Funny how the mainstream support pedos yet they call Tate a criminal, communist jokers\",\"Please god, send me a man like Andrew Tate! Thank you! ❤😊\",\"For someone that didn’t like Tate because of the out of context reels, great conversation. May not agree 100% with everything but still majority of it is true and sad. Feminism has been misunderstood, modern feminism is a whole other thing than what it was supposed to do. Let’s not forget that feminism is why women have now access to education, even the most basic education that being school. Equal opportunities was the ask, not anything else that is propagandised today!\",\"The daily wire should be ashamed for selling out just for views and clicks. Andrew tate is guilty of everything he is accused of, not only is there evidence, he self snitched on himself in a ton of videos. There are text messages showing how the girls were trying to leave and he was manipulating and even threatening them to stay and keep working for him. There is even a video online showing him hit one of his onlyfans girls and verbaly abusing her to keep working. He gets these girls to fall in love with him, he then flies them to his home and manipulates them into working onlyfans for him. He is lying left and right here and Candace is agreeing with him, if they did even a little bit of investigating this pimp they would find out the truth or the more plausible version they ignore the truth for views, since this guy says some good stuff (all con-men sweet talk you). His crimes don't get erased because he \\\"inspires men\\\" now. And if this doesn't show how much of a scumbag he is, just know his girlfriend was 15 when he hooked up with her as a 22 year old.\",\"As a woman, I wish we had a female version of Andrew Tate to follow.\",\"Tate is definitely a good marketer who fits his speech according to his audience. As a believer of traditional values, I am saddened because if this was a leftist accused of similar charges and with a similar amount of evidence against him, I suspect this interview would have been a lot more different. If you go by facts and not by an innate desire to satisfy your political inclinations, it is clear as day that Andrew Tate is not a figure anyone should look up to. I never thought I would use this word, but he is the emblem of 'toxic masculinity' every thing a man should not be. His doctrine preys on gullible men by appealing to their inner desire for societal validity and acknowledgement  and  on women by using  desirable masculine qualities (confidence, assertion, money, \\\"protection\\\", looks eg) to sway them into been used as 'assets' . Overall the internet is his playground and his listeners money generating pawns. \\n\\nThe attack on masculinity is the only reason Andrew is now popular. The market for masculine ideologies is a high as ever. The liberals appeal to the 'softer' and lazier end of masculinity by confusing men into thinking that becoming a woman will make their lives easier and will grant them more attention. Whereas, the 'harder' end of masculinity bring forth men like Tate who capitalizes on masculine strength to undermine . Overall a true man is defined by his strength of character as one who takes responsibility for his actions, has integrity, is compassionate yet assertive, is confident yet humble etc. Id rather have people listen to men like Peterson or even Michael Knowles and Matt Walsh on the daily wire to form a partial perspective of manhood. In the end the answer can only be fully known through our maker, the Lord God Himself as revealed in scripture.\",\"Interesting that Candace didn’t take the time to look at the videos from just a couple years ago where Andrew speaks about luring women in.   I pray that being locked up changed him.  But this didn’t happen 10 years ago.  I have nothing against Andrew but this interview was inaccurate.  She didn’t take time to read the disposition and the proper context was not shown.  Not sure what the agenda is here, but Tate is not a hero.\",\"Continue my comment.... \\nBragging and laughing about taking  money, houses, and everything men had that made Andrew rich. How proud do you feel Candice knowing and respecting a person who destroys families and entire lives financially. Making millions from others misery. \\nThe videos are not from 10years ago, check yourself. Sickening to watch you cover for his vile behavior, read your Bible lady, no Christian could possibly align themselves with Tate's lies and evil.\",\"Mr. Tate by his own account got many people to (young women) to fall in love with him, then used their love to manipulate them into becoming prostitutes and porn merchants. He got men to fall in love with these women he prostituted and then got hundreds of thousands of dollars on the pretense of these women offering the men their love. This is not murder, but morally it is about as low as a person goes short of murder, arson, etc. It was also very conscious, and he offered coaching to young men in how to manipulate others and use them in the same way.\",\"TATE W\",\"This was a terrible interview first, kanye, then tate wth\",\"I think this was the best “modern” Tate interview. Great job 👏\",\"Tates just a pimp. He’s a cunning linguist. Seems like Candace is charmed by this pimp.\",\"Shoddy interview questions.  There are so many RECENT videos of Tate talking proudly about his porn business. He speaks so ugly about women.  I’m flabbergasted that Candace didn’t call him out on it.   Don’t believe me….look them up.  As early as April 2022 he was still in the business.  Not 9-10 years as he lied.\",\"Does anyone here realize, this problem started to arise when tate became a muslim?\",\"Respect MR. Tate, Go and live your life now.\",\"Jocko's a better role model for masculinity than Tate\",\"Hmmm... Candace... I think this wasn't a good look sis. I believe you started out really trying to help people not get caught up in the \\\"work\\\" culture. But now it seems like you're just being counter to that culture JUST to be divisive and not using truth AND empathy to help reach people. Tate has openly contradicted many things he's stated in your interview on record recently but you defend him?\",\"Lol, this interview is biased.

Sad day for me I really did look up to her. No more. Praying for her to see the truth\",\"Candace, I don't know why but you got very biased in this interview. I have many recent videos of Tate admitting horrible things just back in 2020 and he was still doing and proud about deceiving people. There are videos where he says he does and sell drugs, where he's still doing the webcam business and all.\\nYou said you investigated and read yourself  the reports and watched videos and I don't understand how you only fell into so many context-lacking videos of many years ago.

All you need to do is take one second out of your life to look at the LEGAL DOCUMENTS of his case and see that everything Andrew Tate is saying is an utter lie. And it's free to see. Because he didn't just be a nice guy, he tricked women into selling their bodies, which by the way lying and selling your body is against the Bible, and also took advantage of so many guys' weakness. And even now, he hasn't changed his manipulative ways because if you support him, that in itself is evidence of who he truly is\",\"I think Tate used a similar technique on Candace as he did on those girls.\",\"This is the best image laundering I have ever seen.  Everyone should be accountable for their actions. Growing poor doesn’t excuse pimping, human trafficking, selling drugs.  You accepted everything about him because now he is rich!

For example, here he says he didn't do drugs; in another interview \\\"I do drugs.\\\"  Here he says girls were clothed or in bikini; in another interview their \\\"titties were out.\\\"  So which is it??

And i agree tate has changed and for the best. More humble, more calm, better in his speech and he is more in tune with his soul and true self! I am happy to see him like this. I wasn't a fan of him before I think it was somehow fake trying the hardest always to be \\\"top G\\\" thinking that being loud and contradictory with everything was going  to get him there.. somehow yes but seeing him like this is the Real Top G. This true self that btw we all can achieve by being ourselves not with ego but with love thats our true G! Is the hero journey! God bless you Tate I am a atheist believer in God one God but after reading all religions anf spiritual master I haven't convinced to convert in a specific however I got Huge respect to all of them and I will say unless you are like me that without following a specific structure or institution\\u002freligion can behave righteously then find the one that fits the most with your ideal lifestyle. Morals and values! And follow it! It will definitely  improve your life! Also by my years or learning I believe by my own conclusion that hypocrisy is the biggest sin. Character is doing the right thing when nobody is looking.  And that means as well whrn you are alone with yourself be real with your thoughts and find a way to be who you are including good morals and values towards your everyday activities! Oh even with nothing and no one life will be a truly harmonious and beautiful experience. And with something and someone even better.  Is just a different way of living ❤.  God bless us all! What Tate went through was his biggest blessing it bring him closer to Himself.  And even with the evil matrix existing God has the last decision and if he lets something happen to someone is not for bad but bad and good needs to exist at least in this dimension of life because that's the only way our souls can evolve . From pain and love. From ups and downs.  This is the world we are living , and yes there is a way to capture the beauty side of life and that is again to be yourself,  let other be themselves, and love unconditionally others ( that doesn't mean to keep them in their life) if someone disrespect you or harm you leave but forget and move on and still keep an open heart towards life 😊 and I can keep writing lol but I will end. And if you made it till the end well thanks for reading and I hope this was somehow helpful towards yourself!\",\"Tate lied consistently throughout this entire interview.  Candace softballs him this whole time, basically trying to get people to feel sorry for him for some reason. Many of the videos are only 1, 2 or 3 years old! He is GUILTY of sex trafficking!

He is vile.\",\"Candace is propping up sex traffickers now, Andrew Tate is one of the most brilliant con artists look at the previous 10 years. You all love sound of freedom yet say Tate isn't do that. Shame on you, Arrest the Tate brothers.\",\"This interview is just great. You guys are very proffessional calm and confindence in your beliefs. So fantastic. I like how Mr. Tate knows where he stands and stand for his beliefs. However I do find his thought not deep enough. He is totally right about how society is and how it should be. On that point of how it should be tho, I found it shallow. Example of how he views religion: Believing in God is one thing and having a religion is also one thing. Religions teaches about morals , does and don'ts. Which is exactly what islams is all about, but on other hand christianity or shoul I say following Jesus is about having person direct relationship with your creator, and that's where you get deep enough with everything else. With how society is and should be. And relationship is personal, you don't look at what mass is doing to decide if you should be is relationship with you creator.  If you don't know you creator, you don't know yourself, you don't nobody else and you definetly don't understand how things should be. Because only the creator of all things knows how he wanted them to be. He should try to get to know God for him self without any religion as a medium because God is personal and reachable. Praying for him🙏\",\"Andrew Tate lied his way through this interview and Candace fell for it hook, line, and sinker. There are videos of Tate promoting his pimp instructional videos from just a few years ago, even up to his arrest. He also talked about how the girls at the computers were topless or naked. The man hasn't changed at all.\",\"this is disgusting, ignorant, and obviously under researched. Anyone who supports Tate or this video is unable to call themselves a Christian or a good person 👍🏼.\",\"This is the problem.  Any cursory internet search can show you how much Tate lies.  Whatddo You Meme?? did a wonderful video on this interview.  https:\\u002f\\u002fyoutu.be\\u002f-ec_gA-hBNM\",\"Candace should have read the indictment. Only by doing so would they actually have been able to flesh out the conversation that needed to be had. Tate has not changed and selling drugs is not the same as making girls like you for the purpose of making you money which is what he did and is unapologetically defending. If your daughter came under this mans grip first of all as a dad you have failed your daughter but as a father it would be much more disaapointing to have tate as a son. How can tate say hes not sorry for what he has done in the past and be muslim? How can Candace sit there like a monkey and spew the same non sense as tate? Candace if you are Christan then you should know one of the basic tenent beliefs of Christianity is repentance. I just keep hearing Candace throughout this whole interview giving tate the platform like a dummy. He aint no man.\",\"Sad to see so many duped by Andrew Tate and shame on Candace for giving him a pass. https:\\u002f\\u002fyoutu.be\\u002f-ec_gA-hBNM\",\"Watch the video from What do you Meme - he breaks down all the lies and misinformation in this interview point by point.  Looking at the comments and seeing all the praise for this man is alarming.  Personally I can't see how any honest Christian can support Tate.  The videos he made are NOT 10 years old.  There are videos from 2021, he even mentions COVID when making the video.  How did Candace not research this.  He is not repentent for his behavior at all.  He admittedly used and deceived countless women.  He created pornagraphic content.  He was a total liar and phoney in the interview and Candace endorsed it.  Between the Tucker interview and this, I am done with these \\\"conservative\\\", \\\"Christian\\\" commentators.  Let's be honest people...\",\"Hey Candice and Company have any of you seen the YT videos by Whaddo You Meme?? on yours and Tucker's interviews with Tate? If not, you and your followers should take a look, if you have I'd love to hear your response to them!\",\"Candace didn't ask any questions let a line any hard hitting questions. I'm sympathetic towards Tate in this case and am a fan of Owens but this was hardly an interview.\",\"Andrew and Tristan Tate. Thank you for trying to build young men to understand what men are meant to be in society  for the benefit of mankind and ourselves + family etc. Free The Tates\",\"Tate fucked\",\"It's interesting that the media shows us clips of the Tates being misogynistic and arrogant but I think if we actually listen to them in context, this is far from the truth. It's easy to cut comments and make them fit the mainstream immoral narrative. In truth these guys are strong men who are clear on their identity. They have a moral code, stand up for family and loyalty,  and look after those whom they love. It's odd that the world would rather have people confused about their identity, be self obsessed and have a victim mindset,  but frame people who are clear on what they stand for, articulate and honest about past mistakes as the bad guys. Honesty , strength of character and aligning with morals are traits all people should have.\",\"Adrew Tate helped me a lot in the process of my life. Good bless him\",\"Tate hitting the nail on the head twitch streams are more sexual than cams were, music videos that were banned till late because of woman in bikinis when now we having others having sex in them.

Everyone focuses on the haters but even a lot of his early supporters were all going off his old content that hes since changed and grew from. So no one had him quite right and everyone has been misrepresenting him until now\",\"Andrew Tate ripped off men for millions of dollars by using women as a tool. It's why he has money. He got women to do immoral things that they wouldn't have ever done if they'd never met him, like ripping men off. Now they can all go to hell together. Tate is smart and says things that can help men. That's why we listen. He also belongs in jail for life. This is the worst Candace has ever done. I'm really disappointed.\",\"Owens X Tate: The Feign\",\"Tate: \\\"I'm not trying to be arrogant\\\" - Says the man-child who arrogantly boasts about being a \\\"billionaire\\\" and having \\\"Buh-gattis\\\".

I like that he is thoughtful, he speaks intelligently and articulately.  I can see why some higher ups might see him as a threat. \\nHe breaks down barriers with intelligence and he sets the precedence where “they” cannot. \\n\\nI like how you both interacted with each other and rolled off each other respectfully.

Him being offered someone girl and him holding back. It was a good thing because he could have easily become the villian. This dude is so epic, that when he speaks, he reverts to the stoic pose before making eye contact. This guy is great. Also, this was a great interview.. great job on both sides!\",\"Not comfortable with Andrew Tate.  When you can join Islam to feel like your more of a man or you feel closer to God is shameful.   I I I I I is who he is now.  He is only concerned with \\\"I\\\" says he doesn't care about how others think of him.  When his Iman calls him to jihad to kill his non muslim friends will he regret leaving Jesus behind?  Just don't feel comfortable with him.  Does A Tate understand Islam?  He can not take a non muslim into his heart as a friend.  He is hiding behind the need to feel masculine, like all things in life you earn respect it is not just given to you.   I think he should remain in the middle east and find out when the shit hits the fans he will not be considered a muslim only in name and he too will lose in the end.  Ten years is not a long time ago.\",\"Tate has openly boasted in the past about manipulating women into doing porn to enrich himself. He sits here and tells Candace Owens he's not sorry about any of that behaviour. How can any conservative or any decent human being defend this man as any kind of role model?\",\"I really wished that Tate was repentant of his sin and his involvement in the degenerate industry; but i cannot take him in sincerity and a serious person after the arrogance that he shows here.\",\"Why is there a need in todays times, to tell people how they should live their life, christ let people live their life how they want, lets be honest, tate is cool, but you can't deny he made all this online drama to draw people into buying his courses.\",\"Great conversation, thank you. I just wanted to add that Andrew Tates public are not exclusively men. As a western woman, wife and mother of 3 sons I learned from AT so many truths about men: my brothers, my husband and my sons. So many things that I have watched all over the years with them and instinctively knew were finally put into right definition and words by this guy. My biggest thank you for that Andrew Tate. Thanks to the Interviewers who gave this man space and time to speak, like you Candace. He is the first who spoke up about masculinity in the last... how many decades?\\n\\nAs a mother of 3 very young boys it helped me a lot to reflect on their nature, their upbringing and things I want them to leave our home with someday. They will be doing better and their mother will get bester along with them because you spoke up and Allah guided you to this. Thank you both, stay in peace, blessed and safe.\",\"Before this he was praising his father and his upbringing because it was what made him the way he is now, and at 1:14:26 he is mocking people who say the same thing about bad experiences in childhood that made them how they are later. You are tough because your father intentionally pushed you over when you were 3 to help you be a strong adult and people are depressed because they were pushed aside as a child by uninterested parents. It’s the same thing. Get your shit together Andrew Tate.\",\"tate really is a livings Views 😮 3.8M\",\"Hi Candace, \\nAfter the video on Andrew Tate documenting his numerous videos in which he admits to scamming men and doing all the things he says he is against, I hope you will take a harder line if interview him again. The best outcome would be to cut him off and not give him a platform from which to lie and manipulate in order to amass even more wealth. He says all the right things these days and it sounds really good, but the truth is that is only 90 % of the story and the other 10 % makes all that sound and fury for naught.

Then they came for the Catholics, and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me, and by that time no one was left to speak up.\\\"\\n--Martin Niemöller, 1945\\n\\nTate is the least of our problems.  Those that want to imprison you for 6 months before a trial based on false allegations is a bigger problem.  Or governments that think taxing you more or making you eat bugs will bring down the temperature to what they believe to be ideal is a bigger problem.  Or locking you out of banking for wrong-think is a bigger problem.  Or companies and politicians pushing your kids to mutilate themselves or forcing you to celebrate shame is a bigger problem.  Don’t let your incel insecurities drive you to simp for women you hope to save out of this corrupt lifestyle because you think you can’t attract her in any other way.  Stand strong in Christ.  Be a man of moral integrity (unlike how the Tates have been).  Stand for truth and speak up for injustice even if it’s for your enemy.  The whole Tate case shows how easy allegations became convictions in people’s minds.\",\"Tate is someone I will stand with unless he is proven guilty. Simple as that. We need men in the world with a fucking backbone that can see the bullshit of today's society.\",\"The Holy Bible says in the end times husbands will sell there wives!

It's always been enough and always will be enough ALONE. I Pray that Tate picks God, Jesus, The Holy Spirit, we would love to have this man fighting the Good fight with us!! I pray he encounters God in a real beautiful way, he could lead so many young men to the cross, to there faith, to truth, to strength, to the way and the light!!! 🙏 love me a masculine man, however so many lil boys are masculine to there wives etc. And become abusive when there's hundreds of thousands of ways to be masculine not with your feminine wife. Lil boys allow there women to carry all the burdens. Lil boys think protecting your family is only when the bad guys comes, this may never happen in your life time. Protecting your wife from heavy burdens, financial issues,drugs, leading your family in faith, morals values. protecting your family from UN honest people, allowing your women to be in there feminine and motherhood and womanhood and not have to do the man jobs etc. Because she already has enough on her plate.\",\"I only have one question for Candace, would you look at Tate’s legacy in the same way if your daughter was one of the many women he used to build his empire. I highly doubt it\",\"I've grown to respect her quite a bit lately if you put your politics aside and hear what she has to say she makes many valid points. As far as Andrew tate I really am not convinced the allegations against him are true I just don't I've seen people in the past that have been ruined by the media to sensationalized a story. He's rich outspoken and he was living in a country that wants what he has. He's confident and doesn't fit the narrative of this time.

Tate looks releaved that he can speak to someone with a bright and logical mind. Loved this interview.\",\"In my opinion, Andrew Tate is a leader; provider; and a protector. He’s a very strong man. It’s very attractive. However, he is going through something. He is not weak. But who has his back? I don’t know if he has a woman to comfort him of all the things that he’s going through.

Side note thank god for Andrew Tate and Kevin Samuels\",\"Great interview.. I just want to say this is the first time I have seen Tate excuse himself for interrupting. It was amazing seeing the amount of respect he has for Owens and vice versa. What a great interview.\",\"About and hour twenty, hour thirty minutes you literally can watch Tate put his guard down emotionally and mentally. Very impressive interview, both very articulate, and genuine feeling.\",\"Did she call his content stupid and compare it to housewives of beverly hills? or?... I loved almost everything they said, and I, too, wish he didn't convert to Islam. we christains definitely could use him. Christianity, in all it's aspects is a complicated religion for most people. Regardless what this man preaches about is literally true, you can feel it in your soul and intuition, this was super refreshing as always. Much respect for the Tate Brothers! And Candice, because they risk their lives, freedom & future telling us the truth.\",\"i’d marry you andrew tate ❤\",\"Very disappointed in this interview. Tate is a pimp by his own admission. He has bragged about his tactics in his infamous war room. He has zero respect for women. He says one thing in the public eye then says another behind scenes. After hearing one of his war room talks on how to start a porn business, I lost all respect for this guy. He is a salesman. It amazes me that Candace didn't grill this guy. He seems to get away with his hypocrisy by saying that the \\\"matrix\\\" is against him. Lol. He tells men to become a self made man by what.... exploiting women?! He states that he sleeps with them first, making them think that he loves them, then introduces the idea of webcam to help them make money, yet they only get a small percentage. He calls the women his B******. Pimp. Please stop supporting this guy. He says he has never sold drugs, yet has admitted to selling drugs several times on video. It is amazing how people are so easily swayed by someone with muscles and charisma 🤮. God help us when supposed Christian conservatives in this country are elevating and celebrating the degradation and coerced exploitation of women. Disgusting.\",\"I like that some very well educated rational people like Candace and Tucker are now interviewing Tate\",\"This is the first time I've actually LISTENED to Andrew Tate.

I'm genuinely curious\",\"Andrew Tate is a living Legend ❤️👑\",\"Tate is so uncritical of his father that he treats him like God. He doesn't realize that it was his father who betrayed his mother, showed her total disrespect and condemned them to a life of poverty in Luton. Hence his lack of respect for women and his lack of willingness to be loyal and faithful to women. Because if the father of the ideal hero didn't have it, it must not be important. Here, in my opinion, Candace should talk about it - how important is the fidelity of men and their loyalty to the family! Then you don't grow up among drug addicts and pimps, you just have a different start. And this Video from 10 years ago also looks like a cynical recruitment of cam girls. I don't believe in Tate's explanations, they are really not convincing at all.\",\"Andrew Tate 😍😍😍\",\"Love interviews like this, gave him the opportunity to speak without cutting him off.

We have to be willing to surrender to him! I think Andrew Tate has the characteristics of a Christian man, but in my opinion he chose the wrong religion, I respect that he could be open-minded enough to accept the fact that there is a God! But I wonder why he chose the Muslim God (false God)?  Regardless of the fact he is probably one of the most positive male role models of our time aside from religion! God bless you and Andrew Tate  and I'll be praying for you! Everything in mainstream media says about you is false, everything the Romanian justice system has done to you is bogus!

This conversation was so organic, and very insightful. I'm with you that we could have benefitted from Mr. Tate being on the Christian team. Nevertheless he is still on a very similar mission.

He will be seen as \\\"Top G\\\", as alpha or something. How low can humanity get if this guy is actually considered alpha? Well, this low. Western Civilization has been in decline for centuries. He comes here speaking like a Nietzschean Zarathustra, when in fact he is The Last Man--the man who the next generation may not even rise above. This is the real danger of Andrew Tate.\",\"Not completely convinced of Tate's redemption and repentance. This man has always been good at the rhetoric game and charisma. From my experience, people who downplay their mistakes have not learned the right lessons and will continue to behave in very similar ways to their past. I can see what attracts him to the Muslim religion. Those countries do emanate more strength than the western countries. The practicality of it, his personality and temperament also push him in that direction. He is right about how the so called Christian countries being weak and giving in to evil, but bad leadership and weak leaders don't disprove theology.\",\"Great (and long) talk lol.\\nFeel bad that Tate gave up on Christianity.  They were having an interesting talk. Thing is, the government and elites have declared all-out war on Christianity, and they are winning many battles. Pastors across America are limp wristed weaklings who don't preach the hard parts of the bible, or even against sin for that matter. But there are still some who have not bent the knee to compromise and lies. That's why I wish Candace would interview someone like Pastor Steven Anderson. He knows the bible front and back, and can correctly point out all spiritual issues. He could go into the nitty gritty with doctrines and showcase why he is extremely censored in America, having his YT page with thousands of sermons deleted.\",\"Tate thinks he has an empire - he has delusions of grandeur? How has he made all his money? Do we know ? From primping women?\",\"Does tate pimp women ?

Shame on you Candace for not pushing back on any of this piece of shit's claims. Nothing was wrong with the webam business? He has morality? He never sold drugs?

Just because the man has very good speaking skills, which he undeniable does, does not mean that what he is saying is true! None of it is! Same wih Tucker and Valuetainement. All of that was pandering, no challenge, no effort, nothing! For someone who claims to praise the struggle so much like Tate, he definitely is a hypocrite! A fraud and a liar!

They hear what everyone else is saying, but not making a decision for themselves. Do I agree with everything he says, no, but that’s life. Every other “influencer” is much worse. They fake their videos and act like their life is perfect. His videos over the last few years are calmer, he has his viewpoints and isn’t ashamed to share them, but he respects others views until you start attacking him, and that’s when he fights back. That’s what gets clipped and he’s made out to be a terrible person, but it’s entirely out of context.\",\"I love this conversation! Don't agree with what Tate said in the past where it was crossing a line but he has grown, and I stand with Candace on every point she makes.\",\"Appreciation to Candance for being a jem and Respect at Andrew Tate.

This is the 3rd or 4th interview I've listened to of him in the last few weeks.  Not sure why I'm supposed to hate him, but I agree with a great deal of what he says.  NOT EVERYTHING, but he seems like a very logical person with good intentions.  Now I see why the left hates him.\",\"Sheikh Abu Andrew Tate 😂\",\"Top G is a new man.

It's all good let's all keep milking this\",\"To start with, Candace, u acting like a fan girl with this narcissist, is very annoying, doesn’t suit you… Tate is a joke, he needs to grow up & start acting like a man of value (he claims to be). Immature, quite stupid man who exploited women to get where he is (no brainpower to earn money otherwise) & now that he's internetfamous (as loads of idiots), acting like some-kinda messiah (while displaying the lowest level of class). \\n\\nLets unpack the bunch of BS that came out of his mouth…\\n: comparing him running porn webs- to Trump being an owner of miss universe- is laughable. 🤦🏻‍♀️ (as is he calling himself the most famous and most attacked man in the world 🤣)\\n: saying a (real) man shouldnt apologize - is simply idiocy. 🤦🏻‍♀️\\n: saying he has no remorse is idiocy (in eyes of those who think he HAS done wrong) - the first thing to gain sympathy, forgiveness and WIN (even a court case) - is SHOW REMORSE.\\n: he says he lured young vulnerable girls into porn work because he just had to pay the bills and had no other options 🙄 - as if thats an excuse. (and Candace nodding her head in agreement to that (& basically everything he says) is also being UNBELIEVABLY hypocritical - as she’s the first to condemn & shame girls who say they do only fans cause they’ve bills to pay.)\\n: he claims to be a great role model- when his msg is- if you’re poor- pimping girls or selling drugs is acceptable means to getting money. ABSURD. To be a great role model- what he’s done and who he is- is not good enough. PERIOD.\\n: he’s a hypocrite narcissist - in the same minute (min 38) he says “u should make it clear to the outside world what you’ve done wrong, take accountability” - and in the same min- says “no this is who i am and I’m unapologetic”. \\n: “I dont wanna associate with promiscuous women”-  coming out of the mouth of a man who ran a business emploing promiscuous women (and today saying they’re great friends) - is absurd, hypocritical and laughable\\n\\n: he says “If u take any 24 y old they’ve done “stupid stuff” - sure, stupid stuff like getting drunk, sending stupid texts, stealing dads car to go on a weekend to impress a girl- NOT making vulnerable girls do pornography AND collect that money. So no- perv tate is NOTHING like any 24 yrs old who does a bit of crazy stuff. \\n\\n: he said even back then he taught guys how to be a good man - “I taught how to treat her well (by calling a taxi 😂) IN CASE she gets upset (for being used for sex) - means normally if a girl isn’t making a scene- no need to even call a cab. 😂\\n: regarding boys running around asking what color bugatti u have- he said “Young boys r looking for a hero and i fill the gap” - SOUNDS LIKE A DESCRIPTION OF A DEVIL…. Devil is always in disguise as something attractive, and an easy way out- WHICH IS ALL TATE HAS DONE IN HIS LIFE. \\n\\n: Candace comparing Tate to her son who loves trucks, saying “Thats just how guys have fun” ??!? 🤦🏻‍♀️ Liking (or owning) cars doesn’t equal greed, gloating, boasting & bragging (WHICH IS A MORTAL SIN!!) The problem is not that he loves fast cars- ITS IN HIS BEHAVIOUR AND WAY OF SPEECH ABOUT IT. Very bizarre Candace doesn’t understand that.\\n\\n: they both agreeing that the problem is that women today are conditioned to be sluts - when Tate is THE man who conditioned women to be sluts (for profit) 😂🤦🏻‍♀️ Unbelievable.\",\"Congratulations for the brothers Tate for freedom 🎉\",\"19:05 Whole lot respect to Andrew Tate 👍\",\"I don’t like the fact that she was often cutting his speech and posing her opinions whereas He was the one who should have been interviewed.

It's stuff like that which his enemies will pick up on also and use that to attack him. \\n\\nLike Andrew mentions if you went through everyone's past you will find things that are not good.

As a man in his 30's, its not dangerous to listen to Mr Tate because he is 80% correct about the state of man\\u002fmasculinity.  In saying that, I was saddened to hear that such youthful boys are his base, as they can't filter out the 20% that is just asinine.  This is a view point that should be for 21 years and older content (or whatever you want to say a \\\"young man\\\" is), that is the demographic he could \\\"help\\\" as he suggests... but ultimately he is a business man and will take all the views he can get.

Has anyone ever actually seen any of Andrew Tate's videos.\",\"Came here with an open mind. It's so sad that it seems to be Tate equates morality and virtue to worldly riches. There's a regular acceptance of immoral acts ( ie sin) if one has grown up poor. Why?  He seems especially triggered by this hence his refusal to denounce and downplay clearly immoral ( and 'cringy') actions. It lacks a lot of depth. He should try reading some of the Saints like St.Thomas Aquinas or St Alphonsus de Ligori. \\n\\nBut it's a lot easier to write off anyone who says so as trying to take ' the moral high ground' or 'judging him'. Hope he man's up and challenges himself morally and philosophically. Praying for Candace and Tate🙏\",\"I don't know much about Andrew Tate don't know if he is guilty or not. And I like how he displays his masculinity on his sleeve. I also think he has a lot of positive and truth to say but his reasoning when looked at in it's entirety is very flawed. His ego is way too big it's off putting. You have to be who you choose to be but the idea that because your childhood was hard\\u002fvery difficult then you must go the way of drugs and porn to make it is ridiculous and to say someone who was raised in a better environment can't help or have nothing to say to the disfranchise is crap. There are a lot of people whos childhood was worse than Andrew and made something of themselves without taking these roads. He may have a lot to teach young men but it's so wrapped up in arrogance he is not a good role model for anybody. A little humbleness goes a long way. An the audacity that people can't genuinely dislike him or what he has to say it must be jealousy. He is too full of himself and that is a big put off for women. And why was COVID stupid? There was a virus people died from it what was stupid about wearing a mask?. I agree with Candice on a lot of things am a Christian  I hate liberalism but honestly think that you all take on COVID is ridiculous. Did they get everything right no I never expected them too and nobody should it was a situation in which you learn as you go. To say that COVID was some kind of conspiracy is just in my opinion stupid. I have had the flue I have had COVID and it's not the same by any stretch of the imagination. And developing a vaccine for it is just a natural progression. We here in the Caribbean get vaccinated from the time we are born and because of those vaccine we don't have to worry about our kids getting missles, smallpox ect. Our children get the flue and it doesn't kill them because they get vaccinated. I really don't understand this enormousity towards vaccine. This has never affected us here in the Caribbean. At least nobody I know and that's alot of people.\",\"\\\"I'm exceptional.\\\" Andrew Tate is a narcissist I honestly don't know why people follow him 1:13:46\",\"Candice is milking Tate lol\",\"REMINDER: Two years ago your master tate was *teaching men how to entrap women using every devious lie and scheme* in order to minipulate women into becoming web whores so as to enrich pimps.

The things he was doing to that poor girl were things that even tate himself said make him look evil. \\nBut he said he is not evil, he \\\"the shepherd\\\". So notice, tate as a shepherd is lying and scheming against a woman for sole purpose of turning her into a web whore.

I find that David Wood and the Apostate Prophet have an engaging conversation if anyone is interested in a less mainstream take on the anti-Tate side.\",\"Guys, I can't get past yall riding Andrew Tate when he's basically been exposed as a trafficker. Like what is wrong yall??\",\"The Tate brothers are garbage and only naieve boys look up to them. There are some videos on YT that expose them. He has said some things on camera and send some messages that prove what kind of person he really is. He said on camera that he had s#x with girls so they would fall in love with him and then he would lie and manipulate them into doing webcam p#rn. He also lied and manipulated them into breaking off contact with their friends and families. His brother Tristan talked on camera about how to trick virgin girls into sleeping with him. All they care about is money and status, they are not wise or smart...just cunning and good in making money. Now Andrew has converted to islam and is tweeting that Britain should become a muslim state. His real God is money though, who needs 17 supercars and brag about money 24\\u002f7. Wisdom is better than silver and gold, but these guys are slaves to wanting status and flashy stuff. The good things he preaches are just common sense. I can't believe these clown are so populair nowadays, it says something about the IQ of these youngsters that look up to him, there are much better people to get inspired by than this guy.\",\"You can see the IQ difference in real time in those who hate on Tate and those who support\",\"There are serveral clowns in the comments that either watched the whole thing and heard none of it or just talking nonsense and no hater understands tate at all\",\"I think Tate should take more responsibility for his actions.

We owe the Tate brothers our loyalty and courage to defend them not to go to jail or get unalived!\",\"Nah.... He's a pimp, and he does need to apologize, and he does need to exercise healthy guilt over his past misdeeds involving the exploitation of men and women.   Tate mislead and hurt A LOT  of people, and his message weakened men terribly, catalyzing many  to emulate his model of pimping.  Grow up Tate, be a man.  Be healthily sorry.

They have the qualities that a lot of women would love to see in their men . . . .especially the older gen women who remember what men were back in the 70s, 80s, 90s. . . .women now want their men to be submissive, emotional and equal. The Tate's are showing these men, how to be men, and the tears start flowing - #makeitmakesense\",\"Such a great interview. I’m really enjoying this mature version of Tate and Candace was the perfect female to carry this interview.\",\"Love this man Tate\",\"Great interview full of substance and truth!  Mr. Tate will be a Christian in no time as a result of your witness to the truth and beauty of Christian marriage along with your display of strong motherhood.

Every real Christ follower knows, that this way is not about what you SEE, but it's walked by FAITH. The Bible teaches this is so many passages of scripture. Also, the Quran teaches to read the Bible because it cannot lead you to heaven. Tate has been tricked like so many others...SAD!\",\"Literally the best Amdrew Tate interview I love it🙏🏼\",\"I like Tate but I don't agree 100% with him. Candace challenged him in some interesting areas so fair play. Well done Candace and Tate, as always, top G\",\"Listened up to 30 mins and so far my take away is that Tate talks about men as a man and I haven't heard thus far him talking about what women should do and how women should behave. That really stood out for me. I think it's important to stay in our lanes and talk about things we understand from our genetic makeup.

That should be the MO.\",\"Patrick Bet David and Valuetainment also did a phenomenal interview with Andrew Tate\",\"Great interview. To point out something although I tend to like tate especially the non angry tate, he seems to be very insistent on the point that everybody has done something on an equally low level as he did at times. Not sure about that. Everybody made mistakes. But some of us go further down than others. Our lowest moments arent all the same. So I think he could use that excuse a little bit less, as it also doesnt matter much. Just stick to you and what you fucked up and man up to it. (Which he is doing most of the time just this point sucks a bit)\",\"You’ve just lost a long time subscriber. So sad to watch you go further and further from the truth Candace and using the same tribe mentality of the left. Praying for you and your family.

Good luck.\",\"finally someone showing some respect for Top dog TATE. All the other people ive seen are attacking him for being a loverboy and a pimp and lying to and threatening young women and making them do sexwork, alienating them from their home and family, and stealing their money.

But in this video she didn’t confront Tate on any things seriously. They really helped him. You value womenhood and traditional marriage yet here you are promoting a man who promote porn industry. I am all for a fair interview pouring out Tate quality and good doing for young men sens of purpuse. However you can’t overlook why he got put I jail and his wrong doing….\",\"Crazy how many people are saying they didn’t like Tate until this interview. This is how he has always been and it’s been the same messages since he blew up. He just wasn’t as careful about it before the stardom because he was never on a microscope.

She deserves better than that, and so does Mr. Tate, as a guest on his podcast. I really like Mr. Tate’s response to Adam22, and how he was protecting Adam22’s wife.

He’s authentic, genuine, & honest. He always takes accountability as well. I love how he empowers men. Men have become a marginalized group and society claims that all masculinity is toxic.

As good as the interviews he had with PBD. Only difference is the change in Andrew's manners. He is always respectful in his interviews but he is all Alpha when he is conversing in the presence of other Alphas like PBD. With women he is calmer and and gentler.

I’m a big fan of his, but because I’ve watched pre much all of his content I’m picking up whenever he  contradicts himself….. he just said he was finished with his webcam business 10 years ago in the early stages of the internet and I’ve heard him talk about it in long format before on nelk saying he was doing it just two years ago. \\nThats just one example I’ve caught, so i am curious anyone els has noticed this?\",\"I clicked on this video just to see what Andrew Tate was all about, and I only expected to listen to the first few minutes cause I saw how long this video was.

He seems chivalrous in many ways, not all the time, but I think he’s on this Earth to learn and grow and those are admirable traits. I do find it interesting that his interview with Tucker was very grounded and really face to face, so why is his body language with Candace any different than that? Is this considered polite posture with a woman or that he maybe considers an interview by a woman as somewhat “less than” that by a man? This is just my observation and curiosity. I truly hope he’s absolved of the accusations against him.\",\"I'm torn on this. After listening, I felt I misjudged him and then dug into testimony from his court case.

This is not a balanced portrayal of Tate, it's more of a defense of him.\",\"I agree with Tate on everything, except when it comes to therapy. You couldn't be more wrong. Neither of you have any idea of how effective therapy works. I would argue that the reason people even listen to Tate is because it's a form of therapy. In fact Tate even said it himself, it was his Father who instilled these foundations of masculinity into him. But what about the millions of other men who didn't have a Father to give then that? That's where therapy comes in. Don't knock somethng just because you don't understand it .\",\"This may just be the best Tate interview yet!! Figures it would be with the brilliant Candace Owens!!!\",\"Great episode. Tate is a truly intellectual man who knows the truths and fakes behind this system that has corrupted us. Hopefully society understands this man’s ultimate goal is to empower young men. Hard work, determination and discipline are the keys to success. Thank you Candace for doing a really insightful interview here 🙌🏽❤️\",\"1:25:50 Andrew Tate spoke of a woman in proverbs 31\",\"This dialog is what the masses need. Thank you Mr. Andrew Tate and Thank you Mrs.  Candice Owens. Your message resonates.\",\"Like @theglimmerman says, there haven't been many interviews with Andrew Tate conducted by a female.  At the very least by one who was genuinely open minded and respectful and just wanted to ask real truthful questions and allowing him to give his takes.  \\nIt could be because of that that I found this interview to be so different from all the other ones that he's ever given that I've come across.  Andrew has ALWAYS been unashamed and unabashed about his views on ANYTHING!  Even though he was still very confident in his speech and content, he showed a more softer and vulnerable side in speaking with Candace.  \\nWith Tucker Carlson and Patrick Bet David, Andrew was his usual male dominant persona and unapologetic about everything that came out of his mouth.  You can definitely detect a different tone and perhaps a more gentleness with which he was talking with Candace.\\nI also liked how Candace asked about his faith but didn't press on it, even though she did say that she wished that he was fighting on her side, my side as well, as a Christian.  I think that she planted a seed and with proper timing and cultivation and she may be able to broach the subject again in the future and I believe that he'll absolutely be open to talking more about it with her in the future.  And Tristan, being a Christian still, will have a massive role in it as well.  Praying for that!\",\"One of the first times I’ve seen tate ask his interviewer questions. He realised that with Candace he’s dealing with someone with a intellect of his calibre.\",\"Best Conversation!!!!  \\nThank you Candice & Tate for making this happen 🙏 👏\",\"Now this is how you give a logical interview and have a logical conversation.

I never seen Tate smile this much in an interview. Candace you did an amazing job. They are both so iconic ❤\",\"Tate looks good\",\"I like Andrew Tate’s overall message. It is indeed a positive one. But for him to sit there and say there is something terribly wrong with the society doesn’t make any sense. People live according to their convenience and what suits best for them.\\n\\nHe needs to understand people’s circumstances before sitting there and saying doing that is wrong and this is wrong. There is nothing wrong with people doing porn. If they really want and they are getting paid well and living a happy life then there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. But like I said, his overall message is to become better everyday and achieve something good in life and live life to the fullest. But he really shouldn’t think he is doing god’s work. That’s just a pathetic belief he has. And is one which also gets him in trouble all the time. Each to their own. Live life to the fullest, make money, stay healthy and enjoy life.\",\"Really sheds light on Andrew Tate as a person for me. I respect him now and I completely agree with both of you on this.

Before watching this, I had ideas about Andrew Tate and opinions about who he was and what he did and said that were solely based off of misinformation. Even though a large majority of the info I got was from conservative outlets, who I thought were giving him a fair chance. This changes everything. His respectfulness, strength, and ability to admit he was wrong but stand by who he was and is, devotion to God and truth and his religion, is so impressive. While I know he and I don’t agree on everything, in fact, I know we disagree on many things, listening to this has changed my perspective on Andrew Tate.

Thank you for this full length, respectable interview Candace!\",\"I agree with what a lot of Andrew Tate says but he’s off base on a lot as well. He’s cool because he’s unapologetic and stands up for what he believes in he’s cool for his rigid masculinity. I don’t think most people care about his cars or women. Also liberals aren’t cool and sexy. What’s cool is being a warrior and fighting for what you believe in.\",\"Unfortunately, Islam is an open declaration of war against all non-Muslims by its extr𝜖mely int𝜊lerant,  & warl𝜄ke Quran and is especially oppressive toward women.

I’m so grateful that Candace had the Grandfather she had.. love the clear perspective of privileged ‘Prince Harry’.. sad and pathetic.. the videos from eight years ago and ten years ago should be deleted and erased.. I agree with Andrew that eventually the case against him will be done away with.. that’s terrible that the man had to take down the British flags and put up ‘pride’ flags.. Andrew is right about having financial independence and not being dependent on the government.. I am choosy about who I listen to.. I don’t want to listen to evil lies, and evil propaganda.. good conversation.. thank you Candace.. thank you Andrew..\",\"As a husband and a father Im disappointed in Candice for marking out so much to this LYING PIECE OF $HIT.

I wouldn't want to be quoted on something I said 10 years ago. I have grown and matured.\",\"This was hard to watch. This is the difference between a good interviewer like Patrick bet David or even Tucker and Candace.

He doesn’t have respect in Jesus Christ. He has admitted to seeing Jesus Christ as weak since Christianity “allows” people to disrespect Jesus Christ, and has argued that the Muslim faith would not allow that to their god. He believes that power in murder and forcing someone to respect your god is a superior way than giving people the literal freewill to choose who they want to worship. Tate is an inferior man because he settled on the Muslim faith since it allows him to bang other females while being married and to impregnate how ever many females he wants. He picked through religions and chose the one that best suits who he is as a human man.\",\"Great interview Candace, FREE TATE ❤️🔥\",\"I'm a girl and I love Andrew tate ❤ this man say just the truth ❤❤❤❤\",\"Tate is a legend!

I love Christianity as a sister faith and as a Muslim, we disagree on some parts but you'll find that if you objectively study both faiths, Christianity is too simple and basic. In fact, I often say that Christianity is just 1\\u002f33rd Islam and Islam has the full package and set of beliefs that a revealed way should have. Christianity has lacked many aspects and as a result, it needed many things externally from liberalism to socialism to even make sense of itself and as a result, you have these issues. Even Bernard Lewis, often seen as a polemicist of Islam, recognizes this.\\n\\nPlease reach out to more Muslims and you will be surprised at how much of an affinity you have to Islam to the point, a strong and intellectually competent person like you will recognize straightaway Islam is not pariah, its the home of your heart, mind, and soul that many push away and leave it till last.\",\"Imagine a Andrew Tate X Kevin Samuels convo\",\"Tate admitting he was a drug dealer:\\nhttps:\\u002f\\u002fyoutube.com\\u002fshorts\\u002fV7rnySCZ5IA\",\"Tate don’t miss 🎯\",\"Still trying to figure out this Andrew Tate drawing.

Since day one of me knowing about his existence (about 2yrs ago). I always defend him to anyone that tries to say bad things about him. Women today can twist everything being said to seem the way they are told he is and it’s ridiculous! It took me a whole day to get through the whole video but it is genius!

Tate made his living the way he did because there's a lesson in it for him, same goes for all others walking through life. He owes no apologies for what and how he lived his life, and so long as he's being honest, males across this world will continue to admire him.

He talks about his past of sleeping with a bunch of woman, and, assuming now that he has one girlfriend which he mentioned maybe he has reformed. But a woman who has a past who is now reformed is looked down upon, while he is not because he’s a man? LOL. Hypocrites are the worst.\",\"I absolutely love Mr Tate.

He’s an individual for sure like him or not . I don’t agree with everything he says or does but I do respect his passion and his courageous qualities which allow him to defend what he says and does unapologetically. 🤙✌🏼\",\"Tell ya what else Tate better think very very soberly about.  God has blessed him with a daughter.  He himself has unapologetically debauched and destroyed the daughters of MANY other men and gloated about and bragged about making so much money off it for years. It does not matter whether these women came and begged you to put them to work.  Think about that next time you look at your own daughter, Tate. Would you really want any of your staunchest followers to have at your daughter?  I think not. You need to really get serious and focus on what Mrs. Farmer has done for you in this interview which I will not watch the whole of yet simply because I really don't like looking at you and hearing your voice due to what I have listened to come out of your mouth in other videos where men complain about what you have been teaching men to do with women.  I am not yelling at you, Tate.  Tate, if you mess this up, God has a way of striking a person where they least expect to be struck.  Just trying to get you to think with your brain in your head instead of the one in your pants.\\n\\nYour influence in the MGTOW movement which idolizes Andrew Tate, has caused significant turmoil in my own house when my younger brother, who I took in after his divorce, decided he could boss older sis around (he's quite the passive aggressive sort) and make my peaceful home his own personal hell.  Well, I finally booted him outta here and now he is very sick and living in a roach filled room too ashamed to tell us where he lives.  I have no doubt whatsoever that it is God Himself dealing with my brother because he just refused to see where he went wrong and wrecked my peaceful home.  I warned him about listening to the MGTOW crowd, but he wouldn't listen. When I forbid him to listen to MGTOW videos in the house, he would sit in his car for hours soaking up that pig slop. They were always touting a life of fomication all you want, BUT MARRY A VIRGIN.  What virgin in her right mind, Tate, wants a run-through, diseased, morally screwed up in the head man?  The other thing people fail to realize is how much damage sleeping around does to the soul and psyche.  I gotta wonder how many thousands of other homes have had the peace damaged by males in those homes who have begun to put your whack job ideas about women into practice. Probably could be a nice class action lawsuit ... Hey ... but I digress.\\n\\nPeople need to understand the concept of SOUL TIES that get made with every single person you lay down with.  Those soul ties remain unbroken unless and until the person truly repents of the gross sin of fornication, adultery, other sexual sins, and turns from the lifestyle totally.  So, Tate, think about all the people you've had sex with.  They're still unbreakably attached to you now.  When you lay down with your wife, all those others are still there with you two in your bed. It's a heavy spiritual truth people are completely oblivious to and need to wake up to and do the difficult task of really cleaning up their lives before it is too late.  THINK and get to work cleaning up your life.\",\"The fact that people look to Andrew Tate for some sense of honor, masculinity, truth or any virtue is truly pathetic. If you really want to know how to be a real man, look to the most intelligent Alpha male in human history, Jesus, then the patriarchs and prophets, read the old testament which is all about Jesus as well, 300+ prophecies are all about Him, and He fulfilled them all. God is the only One we should be looking up to, not Tate, or even Owens. In His Word, we find morality, love, truth & the future, teaches is how to be genuinely good women, feminine women, and men, masculine, leaders. Stop being fans to flawed human beings, looking to them for direction, cmon now.\",\"Mr.Master TATE ❤❤❤❤ you.\",\"Hilarious!\\nI think Christians have more problems than I do!!\\nComedy Gold..\\nImagine replacing Tate with Bill Burr... :)\",\"I like the tate brothers,.

Basically he's saying that he's above any scrutiny and not going to address the allegations.   I don't blame him for ignoring the onslaught of criticism, however.  I think I think he's missing the point  of Candice's'  probing.  The problem he has is that he's relying on his intellectual abilities to confuse this matter.   The bottom line is that he's not placing his trust in the only person who truthfully judges these matters, namely God!  Remember, there re is a way that seems right to a man, but the end thereof is death.  Jesus Christ, (who he purposefully leaves out), is the  ONLY answer to adding perspicuity to his situation.\",\"By far the best interview with Andrew Tate yet.\",\"Let’s pray for Andrew Tate!\",\"Tate Is an arsehole, but Owens Is the Sphincter.

Getting conservatives to be on the side of a human trafficker and serial liar? Wake up people wake up.

How is that not going to affect somebody?\\n\\nThis little boy - sorry, MAN - makes NOTHING BUT emotional arguments and supposedly rails here against them! I would bet you anything - ANYTHING - he has no kids (though he SAYS he has 'double digits' kids), maybe even is impotent, hence his \\\"I am a super-breeder\\\" dogshit, and obsession with mentoring young men, so he can pass on his twisted info to some next generation. As for \\\"farming and shooting\\\" crap....well...do these people honestly think that these things exist in a VACUUM?\\n\\nDo they think that running some small farm will keep them going indefinitely without having to trade with other farmers, the government, shops, etc? Where is their self-sufficiency then? That's what gets me about all this 'I stand alone' horseshit, including with vaccines: NOBODY stands alone EVER! If the government mandate this or that, and want farmers to go along with it...what's to stop them? A brief, epic, crap, one-sided gun battle with a 'self-sufficient' farmer? HILARIOUS.

His response to it is not ownership, he skates around it. I'm all for growing as an individual but you have to honor the truth. I'm a fan of Tate and always enjoy his content but he 100% trafficked women all the way up to the end of 2022. Problem is we look at trafficking as like the movie \\\"Taken\\\" when it can be sending a girl a DM on instagram, to get her on a date, to sleep with her, then ignore her, then have her obsessed with you and then say we can only be together if you do web cam. That is what he did and that is trafficking.

Imagine all these crucification of Tate just for re educating the ignorant  world what men and women are physically and emotionally in his way .\",\"I'm just gonna say it, the woman that  would fit Andrew tate the most is a black, conservative woman, who has a mind of her own. I don't particularly like Candace Owens, but the way she spoke in this interview was very reserved, calm, feminine and knowledgable. Same for Andrew; this may just be his best interview yet.\",\"I’m a conservative, and a christian. I like Andrew Tate, always have. He is attacked bc the powers that be are afraid of his influence.

I am not sure why you went so soft on Andrew Tate. I think he used you because you are a smart woman. He said do not click on a website like that, but he made those websites, he is charged in freaking Romania with charges that are of the same ilk.  Everyone was happy, I didn't kill anyone, but then says he tried to kill who ever he was against.  That is some kind of reasoning.  Candace where is your point of view that we have come to know and  I am a fan?    Don't get mad this is an honest question.\",\"Great interview, I like Andrew Tate because he tells the hard core truth. He has strong convictions in whatever he says and believes.

I'm a woman & i really like him & i  really respect him as a man. I think he is a very intelligent, very brave & very strong man & i think people are threatened by him & jealous of him. It's so sad & just so wrong what they've done to him.

I cannot fault an interview with tate apart from 1 U turn. Marriage. As someone married and still in a marr8age I have seen more marriages not make it than do. The ones faltered have ALWAYS ended in some sored, seeded, messy and unpleasant way. The women scorns the man through court or threat of court. You sit there one day married happy, on the couch with one of your kids on your knee, the other drawing pictures on the table everyone is happy and content.  Then the women wants a divorce.  She stands up and how to hurt the man... take the status away. Tate is correct. Lie. Tell a judge he just works all day l, he has no time for the kids. He doesn't care. He is abusive in (his language) he shouts blah blah. The woke juge grant's full custody and the house (paid for by the man) to the woman. The man's now on his ass. And he does what... suicide. Cry. Goes to his mum and dad's. His friends. \\n\\nThe reason he sits there and is emotionless though the shouting and abuse and the obvious disrespect is he knows there the the things waiting for him. So through girtted teeth he takes this bullshat everyday to avoid it. \\n\\nThat ladies and gentlemen is marriage. \\n\\nLove your women and your kids. Do not get married as you instant stack the cards against yourself with zero gain.\",\"Everyone hates Andrew Tate because he tells it like it is.....not bullshit.  I'm in your corner.\",\"I think that its a blessing that celebrity interviewers are giving Andrew Tate the plate-form to speak may just become his solvation to freedom because main stream media attack this man's character without giving him a fair opportunity to defend his name.

So I’m glad to see him repent of the actual worst stuff and worst behaviors. If a man can’t bringing himself to recognize women as created in the image and likeness of God and thus deserving of dignity through that then they should at least agree it’s destructive to society to use and abuse another man’s daughters, sisters or future wife.

Check people before you give them video time.\",\"This is the most humble I’ve seen Andrew Tate\",\"Tate speaks facts\",\"Do I have to spell it out for you? The reason they’re going after Andrew Tate so hard, it’s because they’re concerned that all these young adolescent males are going to convert to Islam.  He speaks highly of Islam and says that Christians in general don’t defend themselves anymore and that’s why Christianity is becoming a joke and Islam is still a serious religion because they don’t tolerate the nonsense that the Christians do. Look at the timeline of when they started really turning up the heat on him, it was after he announced that he converted to Islam.\",\"Im a stay at home wife and mother of 2 Sons from Los Angeles and I love the message the Tates put out for not only men, but women as well. ❤❤❤\",\"I love this guy.

To the red pillers, he's  not one of you! I can see a lot of family traditions, honouring women. His change  is partially  due to him becoming muslim..... there's no disrespect for women anymore ( refer to his older videos). Well done Tate, i can definitely  see the change. You wont care but a muslim sister is cheering you on, may Allah help you on your path to stronger faith. And do well in life.\",\"I love Andréw tate!!!

Well done Tate, you are a legend.\",\"I think Andrew Tate would a powerful proponent for Christ if he'd see the flaws and reject Islam.\",\"Thee best interview of Tate I have ever seen. Watched half on different channel, but wanted to give credit where its due and come here for the other half. We'll done. Mo idea why anyone has anything against this man at all\",\"I would argue most people that have an opinion on the Tate's come from 10 second clips that are from long form content. As a religious person and most that follow the conservative side and happen to be religious do understand that we live in fallen state that thankfully we seek the kingdom and God and have is ultimate forgiveness. We each have to decide to be accountable for our misgivings and ask forgiveness from God from what I have seen the Tate's have done on the caming business front. You can argue the morality of this agruement but unless you are Jesus and have lived a sinless life than let's keep it relative. It is frustrating to see a lot of religious people sit from some moral high ground and it turns non religious people from God.\",\"I have so changed my mind on Andrew Tate. He is absolutely 💯 correct about the Patriarchal damage. The Matriarchal status now being inflated to control us. The COVID bullshit and those that got scared over nothing! Men need to be men! Women need to start being women again. We are heading into the dungeons they are building and you better be ready.\",\"At this point, I've seen Tate speak at length to people from all walks of life and it's helped me get a clearer picture of who he is. I appreciate when people let him speak instead of constantly trying to interrupt (e.g. Piers Morgan and the BBC lady) even if you have a difference of opinion. Now, as far as Tate, he's an intriguing and intelligent man who also can be toxic at times, two things can be true at once. I can't say whether I believe he's guilty or not because I know nothing about the case other than the charges but I do believe he downplays some of the inflammatory things he's said and implied that he's done. No, he may not be the evil man some portray him to be but I don't think he's the noble man he portrays himself to be now either. That's his public \\\"persona\\\" now that he's on trial. Yes, people are allowed to change but you still have to account for having said and believed your words and actions, even if you think differently now.

I still don't agree with everything he believes or says. BUT I had never heard his side of the story about the accusations of kidnapping and trafficking, and hearing his side rings a lot more true to me. I haven't seen any evidence to back up his claims besides his claims right here, but they do sound more likely. I would not be surprised even 1% if some conniving woman sought him out JUST to defame him, because of what he talks about.\",\"Tate is Very respectful and articulate\",\"Andrew Tate is a conman.\\nFrom his history of being a pimp for cam-girls and taking most of the money... to his current grift of saying true things about gender issues in culture, but offering only counterproductive solutions to young men.\",\"I am always amazed how Tate changes his dialect from American to British in mid-sentence and vice versa. He's defenitely an excellent speaker.\",\"Which real woman in her right mind would want to get with andrew tate?? Hahaha....\",\"I have a new higher level of respect for Tate and Candace respectively\",\"Credible interviewers having long discussions with Tate certainly have helped build up more confidence in how the 'current' Tate mindset is vs. his 10 years ago (people CAN change as they grow older\\u002fwiser - though it's hard to truly tell on every issue).  The one that still perplexes me is the view on marriage - yes, Tate is fully cognizant of him sounding hypocritical about the 'nuclear family' (since he has multiple offspring with multiple women), it still comes off as such, unfortunately.   You cannot undo what has already been done, but it's also too contradictory to ignore.\",\"You're looking and listening to Greatness!. \\nNo I'm not speaking of Andrew Tate Iam speaking of Candace Owns Trump's New  VP running mate ! ... future FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT!

An Andrew Tate interview that is a proper conversation (I know there is another podcaster who also interviewed Andrew in a very fair manner recently). I will be clear - I never really had a clear stance on Tate. I agreed with some things he said and disagreed with others. I neither liked or disliked him (much to some of my friends dismay who all wanted me to think he was vile). I wanted to form and opinion of Andrew based on a conversation\\u002finterview that wasn’t so blatantly trying to take him down, cut him off during explanations, and this is it!

While I have no idea whether he's involved in a crime like human trafficking, I'm pretty sure he's not a conservative by a long shot.\\nAlso, Tate is in the correct place now, unlike in Christianity, in Islam you can have multiple wives and are allowed to be a pimp.

Hell he said to Tucker Carlson \\\"They're charging me for stealing TikTok money from these women\\\". No they're not lol. The charges list cam work including onlyfans among a ton of other charges. He makes claims like the charges don't mention violence, when they do. \\n\\nTate realizes if you just say something enough, most mindless bots will just believe it because they're not going to take the time to look up the actual context\\u002fsources.\",\"Will be interesting in 20 years time to watch a Tate interview to see how wise he becomes, assuming he lives that long.\",\"I was impressed with him until I saw the video \\\"Untold Truth Behind Andrew Tate\\\" on the Gentlemen Masterclass YouTube channel. Now when he's explaining himself I know exactly what he's leaving out. Like the U.S. Govt leaving out they have been reverse engineering E.T. crashed crafts & flying them since 1947. Or that they recruited Nazi scientists in Project Paperclip after WW2 to build rockets & space ships. It's a lot.\",\"Ya'll lovin on Tate like he's something amazing. he speaks his mind cool, so do I and lots of people, but not everything he says is true or a way one should live their life.

After watching video footage of the things Tate said and what he was doing…. I absolutely believe Tate is reaping some seeds he planted by what he was unapologetically doing years ago. It might not legally be connected to the current case but what he was doing 10 years ago was completely disgusting and predatorial. And I have never watched pornography and believe it is horrible and speak against it and I’m a Christian and a woman. And notice he has embraced a religion that oppresses women and refuses to commit to a woman. It’s clear Tate has issues with woman. Sorry men need to grow in emotional maturity. Again the leftist are very emotionally immature and unhealthy.\",\"You know the like to viewer ratio on anything Andrew tate is very intriguing\",\"One thing I can say about Andrew is that he is a great business man. He did his fair share in creating a problem- p*rnography addicted, lust driven young men and now he is selling them a course on how to be '\\\"the man\\\". Create aproblem- sell them solution. I'm sure that Mr. Tate has some nice qualities we can look up to, but even the worst people have some traits to admire.\",\"Great interview ❤ \\nTate is awesome guy\",\"🔥🔥This is crazy!!

Beyonce and Jay-Z are hypocrites who will do anything for a buck - where Beyonce will blab how she's a LGBTQ ally, yet take big bucks to perform in the Middle East (where they have a hard anti LGBTQ stance).\\nNext Tate is an embarassment to Islam.  In the Quran there are verses that say, \\\"There is no compulsion in religion\\\". So, with the lifestyle he has, privately working out his connection to Allah would be the way to go, not try to paint Islam as a \\\"say a couple of hail Mary's and live in sin and you'll be ok\\\" is how it works.\",\"Forever grateful to Andrew Tate for the way he inspired me to be better\",\"Andrew Tate is a great guy.

Work hard, play harder 3. Alhamdulillah\",\"I almost didn’t watch this because I believed the bad things I’d heard about him. I even remember seeing an article in Australia with a journalist saying something along the lines of “Mothers, don’t let your sons watch Andrew Tate”. I think this phenomenon we are seeing these days is exactly from that saying “hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak mean create hard times”. It’s because we are living in such good times and not having to worry about bombs falling on us or having to find our own food that we are creating all this insanity.

Even if Tate showed any compassion towards a woman I’d protect my son from this man or any man that enters his life that belittles females on a journey to empower himself. Tate is absolutely in one mind set and that has never changed and will never change. He is about owning women and controlling women through fear and rage. He shows no respect whatsoever unless that woman in his life obey him but it’s an acceptance of her existence rather than respect. His past and present videos show this, even in this interview. His religious beliefs confirms his mind set. I never thought Candice would refuse to see the whole picture just because he wants to help a man feel more important in life he still belittles women’s existence. Candice just because you hate trashy women and their lifestyle as many of us do doesn’t mean this man should be worshiped by you. \\nI will teach my son to respect himself and all around him, to only judge ppl on their character and kindness towards males\\u002ffemales. Ppl that are on a path to sway a persons mind to control is not someone to listen to. \\n\\nCandice show me a video of him valuing a females existence. I don’t mean a one liner but real value.

This just seems like he's trying to win in the court of public opinion otherwise his best move would be to stay silent about the case.

Don’t let them ever get the better of you. You’re inspirational because I know you won’t allow them to get the better of you. I recently listened to you discussing and debating with Tucker. Very inspirational.\",\"The claim that people are bothered that tate ran a webcam business is a strawman. No one cares that tate ran a webcam business. We care how he ran it by disgraceful scheming, lying, conspiring ruthlessly against unsuspecting women in order to minipulate them into the sex industry. That is where we judge your pimp master of having a particularly evil depraved heart.\",\"I am one of the few women left who 100%, LOVE, choose, and prefer Masculine Men. Men, please stay masculine!!! We need you, and you are appreciated!!!  As for the Tate brothers, I think they have pretty much lived their life using women, sleeping with a different girl every day and night. I have very little respect for either of them. But besides that I agree with a lot of what he has been saying.\",\"Probably the best Tate interview since the very first Pat Bet David first interview with Andrew Tate.\",\"Tate does not repent of being a pimp 10 years ago. Being a pimp is sinful in Islam, his current religion, yet he will not admit pimping women was sinful. I agree with many things Tate says, but his arrogance and self importance is vulgar. Humility is not weakness. Humility is a virtue.\",\"Best Andrew Tate interview!\",\"Only a clown would be offended by Tate\",\"Finally some great interviews that do Tate's message justice.\",\"first fare interview with tate\",\"Hearing Tate drift in and out of a British accent is annoying AF.\",\"Andrew Tate is exceptional in his speaking, his beliefs, and his physical appearance. Andrew I hold you in high regard and would love you as a partner.\",\"I hope they share the evidence they have on Andrew Tate since they recently convicted him of being a sex offender.\",\"Thank you for this video, I admire A. Tates character and his resolute personality in regards to how he lived his life and how he is living it.

I grew up in a household of a strong independent woman with 2 sisters  and obviously we turned out like that also but she had to be that strong woman because no man in our lives ever provided that strength to help her so I've always been that hard minded woman that feels she can do everything until you. I have been wrong and that's why I am were I am today relationship wise lol I was always the power house that made the man not feel like a man I suppose and you have opened my eyes!! That is huge for me and wish I would've had you in my life a long time ago 😂 but I will definitely be getting my sisters to listen to some of your shows to see how open their eyes can get 😊 I can't say enough, THANK YOU for being out there!!!!!!\",\"Candace matchs andrews flow and energy. \\n\\nBoth are very sharp and quick witted.\",\"It’s ironic how much Candace dislikes the porn problem but she is respectful of a man that started growing his wealth and power from promoting young woman to do web cam sexual acts ?? Hypocrisy is massive You know who does care about what you did 10 years ago?? The young woman you conned into making you rich. Pathetic\",\"CANDACE OWENS!!!!!!!!!  What is wrong with You?  It take just a little effort, JUST A LITTLE. I watched another program that did the work and found the actual document of his CHARGES!  He is actually CHARGED with trafficking and rape YICK.  No wonder he became Muslim instead of Christian. To come to Christ you humble yourself and face your sins. You repent!  You no longer have my respect nor will I be your audience.\\nWhat is wrong with you. You and he are so arrogant.\",\"I love u candace owen❤❤\",\"Candace is a man\",\"Woooww bringing a human trafficker to your vids go Candace\",\"Oh wow, what a nice interview with a real man that follows jesus and traffics and rapes women .

Candace and Andrew keep it upppp\",\"Great interview. I'm a big fan of both Candace and Andrew 😊\",\"Has Candace lost her mind with her pregnant brain? Looking like a schoolgirl at her crush, speaking to a madman, who says he stopped abusing people but in real time having several wives and psychologically abusing his children (what we found out in the interview with a psychologist). Actions speak louder than words. These two are crazy psychopaths and mustn't be around people.\",\"Candace , Andrew ... Respect !\",\"this is the best podcast positiveness, candace let tate to finish talking. so nice!\",\"I want a smart women like Candace owens ❤\",\"I’m glad I found this interview I am so late because I had to study for exams.

I didn’t even know Candace had her own channel I’m going to subscribe and watch this in the gym\",\"Oh Candace, what happened to you.\\nI wish for a safe delivery and really ask you to reconsider what you are doing to women as a group. Like, don't take advice by a porn star but take advice by a violent pimp?\",\"Vomit vomit vomit. So much bullshit ! How are people not listening to the toxic way he describes a woman's vital role being to simply just serve the man? And Candace saying it's okay to call people mean things like fat and ugly cause that's how you get stronger?? Lol! How are people lapping this shit up? Shocking.\",\"Grateful for this conversation. Learned a lot. Thank you Candace and Andrew!\",\"He coned Candice\",\"Over 5 million views is crazy 🥴 Great stuff, candace 🙏🏻\",\"Such a liar and a hypocrite. I'm actually ashamed on your behalf Candace. This isn't an interview, it's a fan girl meeting her idol. Anyone with eyes can see that there are no real questions and challenges. She's literally feeding him defences. Can't believe I actually respected this women, now I see how much of a hypocrite she is. Disgusting.\",\"Thank you Candace for all of your hard work- I believe your work is changing lives for the better.\",\"Candace is such a unicorn woman.\\n\\nIntelligent\\nYoung\\nBeautiful\\nListens attentively\\nResponds without bias or attitude.\\nIs also forward thinking & rational.\",\"i can watch Candace n Andrew all day thank you both so much for this\",\"this is the best conversation i have heard in a VERY long time!!! good job Candance and Andrew!!!

If the comment section would really take the time to study this man's behavior, his actions, and unrelenting egoism, the comments would certaintly shift.\\nThat's not to say that Candance isn't doing a great job here, she certaintly is-it's just that this man should not have a platform.  Ever.\",\"At first, i was not a candace owens fan but over the years I have been more central leaning. However, as I got older I  find myself becoming more conservative. I started really listening to her and candace is more correct than wrong in her analysis of things.

I've always loved Candace, but I didn't expect to be so impressed with what this guy says !

All of them.\",\"Love Candice’s doesn’t take bullshit and says it like it is\",\"I was starting to like Candice until I found this.\",\"Candace needs to learn her place and not talk back so much\",\"This is honestly disgusting. I used to really like Candace but to defend a sex trafficker who has admitted on video to tricking women into thinking that he loves them so that they will do sex work for him is beyond low. I can’t believe that in the same breath Candace will call Crowder a monster for verbally abusing his wife (which is true and I agree) but will also defend the Tate brothers who use the Lover Boy trafficking method to get rich off of exploiting underaged girls. People like Candace Owens say that they want to protect children from groomers when Andrew Tate is the biggest groomer there is. He admits to hiring underaged girls on video and deceiving them into the web cam career and makes them dependent on him so that they can't leave. This is very disappointing and hardly even an interview. Thanks for cutting out the rest of the clip Candace when Andrew admits that he doesn’t pay the women who work for him enough. Where was all of the evidence? It seems Owen’s evidence is limited to the testimony of the accused. This is just Candace agreeing with the scumbag Andrew Tate for 3 hours. Absolutely disgusting. I hope this man rots in jail for the rest of his life for exploiting women and scamming the gullible men who pay for his stupid university.\\nProof that Andrew Tate should go to prison and that everything he said in this interview was a lie:\\n https:\\u002f\\u002fwww.youtube.com\\u002fwatch?v=2tYhawrNc_k\",\"Given that I consider myself a realist, I like Candace and Andrew. Very honest open people who don’t back down from the truth. Hope they continue to be this way.

Again, Thankyou, hope you and your family are well and healthy.\",\"49:07 Wow that is the first time I seen Candace's breath patterns lose rhythm.

Candace is giving \\\"groupie\\\" not journalist. She just went there to prove to Tate that shes on his side, her mind was already made up. \\nShe did not challenge him, she did not include the evidence that is available everywhere. The videos that he himself is admitting to these crimes. Im disappointed in her. Shes usually right but, this is like the Oprah, Herry and Meg interview.

This man is beyond disgusting and extremely disturbed mentally. His speeches especially about women are absolutely horrific. Candace is the perfect example of someone with no personality, just a cloud chaser and will do anything to go viral and get some views.

Abrazos from a Mexican woman that admires you tremendously\",\"God bless you Candace and Andrew.\",\"Candace I have been a supporter of yours for so long now but this is ridiculous. Sloppy journalism on your part. Its time you came out and owned up that you were wrong about him. If you believe this guy hasn't been coercing vulnerable women into the sex industry, if you have not seen the vile awful stuff that he has been caught ou saying? If you haven't listened to the women and the people who know what this vle person is doing then I will not be able to ever believe anything you do in the future and plenty of others will be turning away from you because you have lost all cred and integrity.\",\"At this point, DW should just cut ties with Candace and reduce damage.

I wish you the best.. and perhaps some clarity.\",\"we love you candace\",\"I’m late watching but right off the bat I noticed Andrews comfort level with Candace.  I think this level of comfortableness comes  comes from respect.  First interview I’ve  seen him do without sunglasses. The eye contact  and the fact that he was not cutting her off when he didn’t agree with  her opinion.  And  can we talk about the way he  says her name!!!\",\"love this and love you candace! great inspiration\",\"This is my first time listening to owens candice ...she is fantastic 😍\",\"Candace🥺\",\"Amazing she didn't go over the charges at all, He's changed the last 5 years? videos from 2022 shows he discussed continuing the webcam even then and Aliona was brought over from Modolva and the chat logs of him bragging about getting her into cam business from jan to March. Even the rape charge Candace didn't touch any of the issues, if she believe they are fake then say that by stating what they are. Candace had a month before this interview to review the released indictment and she said nothing about it. Just sad to give him a puff piece\",\"3:05:26 I made it to the end guys ….. just two pure souls speaking their truth I love Candace and I am a big big fan of Tate ….he helped me in most ways I can’t explain\",\"Love me some candace\",\"Love this guy 😊\\nI find myself agreeing with him quite a lot.\\nI learned about him through my son 🥰 I was skeptical at the very beginning  but now we’re all fans of him ❤\\n\\nThank you Candace for inviting him 😊\",\"Your awesome Candace. I appreciate your intelligence and for speaking the truth. One love! 🤙🏽\",\"This is were I lost all respect for Candace. A Christian woman promoting a man who made courses on how to pimp out woman, talk down on woman as if they are less than human. This is what Jesus ment when he said there a Pharisees. Your a clout chaser Candance and should probably be in the kitchen taking care of your kids but of course you don't practice what you preach.\",\"Candace is so beautiful...  woman from India ❤\",\"Candace making excuses for this obvious misogynist raises more questions about her than anything.

You’re disingenuous here Candace\",\"Thanks Candace and Andrew, what an enlightening interview\",\"Andrew Tate and Candace need to go onto a bunch of talk shows together 😂\",\"I’m starting to like Candace Owen and trump. The real people get hate on like Candace, tate and trump. People love fake and weak people because they want to be on top of them.\",\"I respect that Candace is trying to be open-minded and wants to think about things without taking the first thing she hears, but I do also think she's bought into a very skewed and negative world view. A lot of the bad things people think are going on in the world simply go away if you don't focus on them.\",\"Candice need to go in to politics the states needs a woman like here\",\"Candace manages to call herself a victim and defends Jay Z selling crack...lefty move.\",\"I am very surprised that the truth about the Royal Family hasn't been exposed to Candace.

If it hasn't,  we should ask her to dive in!\",\"Candace I can say I’ve never watched your show and truthfully the only things that I know about you is your political standing in addition to that I know about ur politics by watch it through more leftist media outlets, and now as I’m watch u on your platform and to here you open up and talk about you background I feel totally bamboozled. Andrew Tate brought me here and who would known that you and I and a lot of my peers have in common. All I have to say after that is, I’m definitely now a fan. Keep doing your thing sis. Great show✌🏾\",\"Candace also said ta ta ta ata\",\"Candace's beauty is truly captivating, and what sets her apart even more is her remarkable intellect and eloquent way of expressing herself.

The first time I saw him a few months ago I knew he was a creep. He’s a major BSer, egotistical liar and a sociopath who’s indicted for sex trafficking and rape. He admits on videos that he sold drugs, for instance, now he says he never sold drugs.  What an idiot.  Then there are tapes where he claims to be a trillionaire. Then he backs off to billionaire. Then he says he’s the smartest person in the world. Really?  Come on “conservatives.” If you fall for this clown then I wonder if you truly are conservative.\\n\\n“10 years ago,” he says.  There are tapes of him admitting he is still in the cam business and bragging how he controls women and cons men out of money from one year ago. And also screenshot video proof of him going back and forth with his accomplice trying to break a woman to cam for him in June of 2021.\\n\\nCandace and The Daily Wire really took a black eye with this interview. They should come out with an apology that they allowed the creep to lie without pushback. Candace goes crazy over Cardi B, but gives an admitted pimp and extortioner a pass because he “sounds” conservative and talks tough against the “matrix.”  The Tate brothers don’t know the first thing about “manhood.” Does Candace and the Daily Wire have no shame?\",\"Came for Andrew, stayed for Candace 🫶🏻\",\"Wish I could have eloped with Candace instead\",\"This is the best interview on both sides that I have ever seen in my entire 41 years on this earth. Both Candace and Andrew are extremely intelligent people and it's so nice to see 2 people talking about issues and not trying to yell or talk over each other and just have a conversation that people can learn from. \\n\\nCANDACE OWEN NEEDS TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT!

Great job Candace!!\",\"He is a terrible human being. He hustled men and women for money, bragged about conning them out of their homes and life savings, bragged about trafficking, using, and discarding women.

This was so easy to watch\\u002flisten to. Great conversations and interview.\",\"Wow Candace, I didn't know you could stoop this low.\",\"This interview just shows Candace hasn't read any of the court documentation lol\",\"I’m both disappointed and disgusted by Candace after her support for Tate. She claims to be a conservative Christian woman, yet stands in defense of a man who pimps out women for financial gain, a man who consistently degrades women and has a false sense of true masculinity. Candace is a liar and is only supporting this man to maintain\\u002fgain followers who are also Tate followers.\",\"Candace Owens, did he pay you to do this interview?\",\"supporting a human trafficker, Candice? That won't be saving the Tates from prison lol\",\"Damn candace literally sided with 5 pedos and basically agreed that a minor was the predator.

It's very much a different vibe to this interview than the PBD one or Tucker.

She really sat there and ate every bite of his horseshit. This lying piece of shit. Literally made a video entailing how he manipulated girls by sleeping with them. Then just completely went step by step and described how he would use these girls to make money. Yeah hes trying to talk a good game now. That hes gonna go to prison eventually. He talked to much in the past on camera. Tate you cant lie to real conservative people that know how to check your receipts. Your a conman. And Candace has really lowered herself in the past 1year. After cowardly trying to expose Crowder and his wifes trouble on her youtube channel. To now this. Ben shapiro needs to wake this bot lady back up. Cause shes way off base. That crowder shit. No matter what he did or said. Candace should have had more self respect\",\"It's really awful that society tells us it needs a girl to stand up for girls, because most absolutely flap.

Based off of the things he has said within the last 5 years, he is a sex trafficker.

Why is it that Candace is so hard on everyone else and digs up every detail imaginable to show the ugly truth but then glosses over all of Tate's revolting details? Is this just for views and money?

Onlyfans or not he is a scumbag, not an entrepreneur. A \\\"webcam business\\\"  PLEASE.  He openly talks about preying on women so that he can make them fall in love with him so he can pimp them out and beat them and lock them in the house while totally controlling their lives.

I’m very impressed and loved the interview!\",\"Candice is such an interesting force. She has natural immunity to the racism and mysogny cards, which means she is hard for them to deal with.\",\"I was extremely sad at how Candace carried herself in this interview. She came across as far too agreeable and looked like she has been duped by Tate. I think the reason why is because she came at the interview looking to allow him a free platform to express who he is and not push anything onto him. Which is great to hear him speak and allow him to explain things but she had no push back. Andrew has great things to say and i myself would agree with him on a lot things. She had plenty of chances during this interview to ask him the hard questions. Push back a little Candace! Just as much as the left and liberalism isn't the way to bring up strong minded men and bring back a true masculine man and leader. The same is Andrew Tate is also not the way to bring men back. He isn't a good role model and shouldn't be looked at as such. She had plenty of moments and she missed them. 😐\",\"You've lost my trust and the trust of any faithful Christian, Candace.

That's how far away we are as a society from understanding God's message.

She has no clue what so many women go through in marriage. She thinks everybody has the means to stay home and not work.

Nice Candace has such a nice life financially that she can stay home and take care of the kids and be just fine. \\nI was married for 30 years and I quit a good job to stay home and care for my kids working out of my home still having to bring an income. Now my husband is gone and I have no retirement and have to continue working for the rest of my life. Candace you are completely off base. I also stayed with my husband who was abusive quite often for my kids sake. I stayed, so do not sit there acting like you know every situation going on because your situation is not what’s common.

It's so obvious I'm left bemused that anyone could lap his crap up. I tried to give him a chance so I watched a lot of his content. Then I watched him lie straight to Candace's face! It's like he has this spell on people, it's so odd! I think Liz Wheelers take on him is accurate. The things this man has done, up until VERY recently are so sick and disturbing...I genuinely think he could be a danger to young mens minds! Why not promote someone like the gentleman Jordan Peterson? And I agree with a lot of what Andrew talks about, but he knows exactly what he's doing...he's a master manipulator. \\nWhen Candace said previously that she doesn't understand why people can't see that Stephen Crowder is lying when he's speaking she was 100%...I feel the exact same way about this piece of crap\",\"Candace I’ve been following you for a good while and thought I had a good understanding of your moral and spiritual beliefs as well as political. Saying that, I was pretty sure that we were in agreement on most all of the content on this YouTube channel.  Except this one.  \\nCandace, I’ve watched you do your homework\\u002fresearch on guests or as with the young lady in the indictment, not a guest but someone you’re looking in to. Why did you NOT do that with Andrew Tate? Just this past year have I heard about him and what he’s about…..it took me a day to discover what it is. And it’s not going back 10 yrs. Try 2-3 yrs. Yes people can change but he’s been on other shows and by the way he continues to talk, he hasn’t. Except to not be so open now about issues that may hurt him with his case. \\nAnyway…..my point in even writing today is I’m sorry that you were taken in by this man. Or whatever it is. By doing so, you’ve given legitimacy to him and his beliefs by your ‘acceptance’ of him and therefore thousands of young people that follow him now think he’s even ‘better’ than they did before……because a Christian, Conservative woman has given him a voice and taken up for him on not one but two Podcasts. \\nI completely do NOT understand this one as you give him a Pass for his Past (10 years) but on the next Podcast the young woman’s Past is diligently researched and she’s not given the same Pass. I understand you were showing her MO before meeting AT but why the kid gloves when discussing or (not) looking into his past? \\nThere’s more but this is already too long. \\nCandace I believe everyone deserves a fair trial, to be heard, etc., what I’m trying to understand is why you didn’t treat him (or rather your research on him) the same as you have other guests or with this case, the young woman that’s involved. There’s so much and so easily accessible it wouldn’t have taken that long. I don’t mean clips taken out of context, I’m talking about entire podcasts with context. It’s all available, unedited.

Unapologetic even.\",\"I love Candace, I didn’t like  Andrew Tate at all and watching this interview is showing growth and maturity in his character.\",\"This felt more like PR than an interview.

There are countless incriminating clips of him committing human trafficking, and him explaining in detail how he has done it. He is extremely manipulative and has either manipulated Candace into believing that he isn’t guilty, or Candace has chosen to ignore all of the clips that were taken from 1-3 years ago where he talks about pimping and manipulating women into doing sex work for him.

He even acknowledged and said “I know… I know what your saying and it’s true” after she said “could have used you” Meaning with his influence on men and young men, Tate could be used to led his audience to the truth, way and life of Jesus Christ. You can see the spirit at work. Candace was Christ-like and gentle and the truth will always make you pause, perk up and lift the veil and discern. You can tell Andrew felt something in the moment. He knows the gospel (Bible) and what it means to be used.\\n\\nLord we pray Andrew finds his way, the narrow path and can be used for the Kingdom. Lord continue to use Candace in being bold in her faith, as a disciple for Christ and delivering the truth. The truth sets us free. In Jesus, name. Amen 🙏🏼\",\"Top G 4 Life ❤ Candace\",\"Candace can do bbc and cnn job way better. She’s smarter, high IQ, says it as it is and doesn’t hold back.

Very cool to witness it in reality.\",\"This has the same narcissistic and journalistic feebleness that the Oprah and Markle interview did. No tough questions, victimhood, and no facts. Sure a cam business is not illegal but neither is abortion and that brutally ends the lives of innocent children. Following laws is not indicative of morality or character. Candace, if she was as “hard hitting” and “honest” as she claims to be should have done better but then Tate would not have sat down for this interview. If no one from the daily wire takes Candace over the coals for this then it is just like the rest of the legacy media it criticizes.\",\"P E R F E C T !!!!

What a good influence for women and men.\",\"Notice all the Christian Countries are the most liberal with the exception of Russia, as a matter of fact Russia has laws in place protecting Islam.

It really gave me pause and made me think about the way I live my life and if I had become distracted from my goals. Candace showed what a skilled journalist she truly is\",\"Wow. Looks like Candace has drank the Cool Aid. Good to know that men never should feel sorry about what they’ve done in their past no matter what. No caveats on that, but I’m sure that line of thinking won’t ever go astray. Andrew has said he has sold drugs in a video. This was such a nicely rehearsed “interview”.\",\"This interview will be remembered for decades.

She did so well with the BLM investigation. Another indictment is in the works. This man is fighting for his life and he will say anything to paint himself in a better light. He can say this is in his past but with video evidence and documentation from 2016 to 2022 it's not. This isn't about tik toc videos or a former web cam business. I know alot of men are motivated by some of the things he had said. Two things can be right at the same time.\",\"Great interview, thanks Candace.\",\"2:38:27 mY FRIEND brANDON lMfao. Who cares???

Not surprising though\",\"I am 16min in and I am so overwhelmed by the sheer self-absorbed and egotistical crap… like I get it, a celeb requires a certain amount of that in order to have the ambition and progress… however LISTEN TO WHAT SHE IS SAYING AND ANSWER THE DAMNED QUESTION!

We get it dude, you don’t regret anything and you didn’t ask to be a influencer BUT YOU INFLUENCE SO how about you clearly state your stance. Either, these young guys and boys should facilitate pornographic avenues or not. What is your stance? Sheesh\",\"Candace I love you and respect but this interview HAS INCREASED THIS RESPECT AND LOVE!❤️❤️❤️❤️🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽\",\"Absolutely soft ball interview. So much for \\\"facts and logic\\\", she can't even read 5 minutes worth of court transcripts that are mostly of Tate incriminating himself. He admits to trafficking and keeping these women isolated and away from their families.  Endless documents proving he used the lover boy method. He admitted to tax evasion. And he tried to bribe a Romanian politician to get him out of prison. Candace Owens is such a pathetic grifter. She shits on people for the most innocuous statements like Zendaya saying she can't cook therefore she's a terrible influence to young girls but will simp for an actual human trafficker.

You bang on about being religious and worshiping God and yet you are giving forum to a female physical abuser who barely looks at you when he is just talking about himself without Any questions or respect for you. Watch this Egomaniacs rant back Candice and tell me if he gives you even ONE look of respect for you that's not just a mildly masked pissed of glance?\",\"Come on Candace. He is a Narcissistic egomaniac that really doesn't care what You are saying but more that how he can Again hijack the conversation to toss off. Lets call a spade a spade. He literally likens himself to Batman and continually uses \\\"I\\\". He has No respect for You Candace, He just wants to stroke his own ego. Seriously Candace??!! Telling him young boys worship him?? Don't throw fuel on the wrong fire \\nWhy on Gods green Earth are you supporting a woman abuser who you can clearly see is an angry man who has no respect for women?????\",\"I was saying when Andrew went home that I wanted Candace to interview him!  Amazing job, love you both! \\u003c3\",\"Has anybody else noticed the weird cut that occurs only on Candace's side at 1:57:01 ? She's obviously there with him and the shot proves it a minute before but for some reason, there's a cut that only affects her and her posture.

Never a bored moment with these two.\",\"So is Candace anti gay? I don’t really grasp who she really is at 1:34:15\",\"Hope Candice doesn't get the lover boy method 😂😂😂\",\"It's a reminder how much I was influenced a few years ago by the matrix and could not stand hearing Candice speak or hear her name. That changed but seeing her opinions even with Trump going after the media and seeing she can dislike someone while agreeing with one thing they did. Definitely a great perspective and reminder for myself to stop looking at the cover\",\"The way he says “Candace” 😂😂😂\",\"Great interview, Candace! 👍🏽🙌🏽\",\"Candace talks WAAAAAY to much about herself. Shut up and let the man talk.\",\"Wow! This outta be good! Let’s go Candace !!\",\"I feel like Andrew spoke very well in this interview. He kept Candace in here feminine aspect and you can tell she enjoyed the conversation.\",\"I almost started to like him by the end of the interview then remembered what he really thinks of her based on past comments he’s made about women. I like Candace but I wish she would have asked him his current thoughts on women like herself who have careers. Does he still think she’s her husbands property? Does he still think her income should go to her husband because he owns her? Does he still think she’s worthless because she’s a women in her thirties instead of an 18 year old? 🤔\",\"Love how wayfair is riding Candace’s coat tails during advertisements\",\"Candace getting more & more cringe these days... having this fool on like anyone actually knew of or cares about this clown. Something's off about daily wire. Plenty of facts & data but they all have that Shapiro'ness about em. And that other weirdo who got caught on cam threatening his preg wife. Something's off. 🤔\",\"His honesty is refreshing. Thanks Candace, for doing this interview. Love you, girl.\",\"What a powerful powerful conversation. This was so reassuring in this crazy time we are living in. Thank you Candace ❤\",\"Tate has grown over the years and has some good qualities, however Candace is basically the devil. You can feel her motive is run by hate and separation.. picking sides and constantly judging in such a self righteous way, unwilling to question her dogmatic, rigid beliefs. No message of love or unity comes from Candace, she belongs on the mainstream news.\",\"I don't know why Candace is wasting time with this guy for any reason other than cheap views. He clearly WAS a scumbag, if not still. Comparing himself to Genghis Kahn, being the king, get the fuck outta here buddy...\",\"Andrew embodies what it means to be a true masculine man and Candace embraces her true feminine nature. This is how a relationship thrives and if we can all embody this, the balance of the world will be restored.\",\"12 minutes in and I'm getting annoyed that he doesn't show Candace the respect to let her finish her sentences.\",\"Bula from Fiji.

Leave working for independent women.\",\"Candace Owens is a snake for what she did to Steven Crowder pos\",\"Really nice of Candace to give a voice to a sex trafficker.\",\"I love Candace but she didn’t do her homework. This guy is a tool. I heard him say evil things concerning women and how he used them and disposes of them when he’s used them up. He’s guilty of the crimes he’s been accused of; mark my words. He’s manipulating and using well meaning people like Tucker and Candace. 😩\",\"Yess Candace and tate love you❤ both of you I  support all the way Candace I was waiting for you to do this interview I knew you would do the best job\",\"Never heard of Candace Owens before this interview but we need more intelligent women speaking real life truth in the media like her, instead of these whores just shaking ass on every platform 💯\",\"Uhmmm we need more interviews from Candace!!

Was great to see Candace get Andrew to talk, instead of the garbage that the BBC could manage.\",\"Candace is speaking 100percent pure facts about what's wrong with our society right here 1:40:11\",\"Why didn't Candace ask -why he moved to Romania of all countries?\\n-Which government accused him?\\n-Why not Move to Hungary?\\n-Let him explain why they want him silenced\\nEtc...\\n\\nSo many interesting questions she did not ask!\",\"I love Candace, she didn't attack him. She allowed him to speak. I think he is very full of himself....he has many good.points. but comes.frim a man(human) point of view...does not claim Christianity....has some values\",\"Two powerful humans team Tate and candance\",\"The more I revisit this interview, the more disgusted I am in both Candace and Andrew. You were clearly kissing his butt and totally enabling and validating his narcissistic behavior and expressed viewpoints. When you delve into the actual facts behind this person, it’s very clear you conducted this interview in a state of cognitive dissonance. You’re smarter than this, Candace. \\n\\nSO MANY illogical statements and displays of lack of empathy.  \\n\\nBoth Candace and Andrew emulate toxic masculinity. Candace, I’ve followed you for years (I think 6 or 7?). You’ve really developed narcissism and need to get a self reflection check in asap before it gets worse. \\n\\nKarlyn did a great job with her analysis. https:\\u002f\\u002fwww.youtube.com\\u002flive\\u002fMjE_TCCKt78?feature=share\\n\\nA healthy masculine man has healthy femininity within him, just as a healthy feminine woman has healthy masculinity within her. A healthy masculine man does not lack empathy; he cares about the feelings of others, including other men, and does not treat emotions and feelings like they are inferior and unworthy of respect, or that a man who feels is not masculine. Andrew is extremely wounded and unaware of himself. It’s all over this interview and so blatantly obvious.\",\"He’s facing away from Candace & only looks her in the eyes. When he reverted to Islam you could begin to see the differences in character. It’s great to see as a revert myself.\",\"Respect To To Candace For This   This Is Deeper Than Just Watching\",\"Lorrrdd what an interview, i knew this was going to be good but the interaction actually BLEW MY MIND…\\nCandace we love you!!! Thank you Tate!!!\",\"At 1:57:03 you can see the video was edited. Notice Candace’s head. Interesting.\",\"LoL Candace got turned off after that spank video 😂\",\"First time I’ve seen Candace Owen and wow I’m impressed\",\"Candace owens gained a lot of ground with me with this interview but she most certainly is putting herself at risk with this interview.  Hopefully it's too late for the opposition to make a move which would mean a large mass of the populous is awake\",\"Candace is a great example of a good Christian, God will reward her when she enters Heaven one day! I truly hope Tate learns the truth one day that Jesus is Lord. he turned away due to the false Christians and speaks as if there arent a mass amount of true Christians that do not behave that way. He says these things as if there arent a boatload of terrible muslims too.. i have a bad past which God saved me from, and truly i tell you the most vile people i ever met were muslims. cant compare those with strong faith in one religion to the ones with weak faith in the other, its not accurate and its not fair. lastly, we are told as Christians to not be violent, turn the other cheek, show love. Him saying mocking us and God and us not doing anything whereas muslims will kill you if you do that to then… thats not exactly an argument in their favour. that just tells me they are more violent than Christians, and Christians are doing the right thing that God told them to do.\",\"Candace is sooo fucking MOMMY its scary, tell me what to do😂\",\"man this was the shortest 3 hours ever lol. such a great and refreshing conversation; so natural and intelligent.

One thing I can’t get on board with though, is their view on mental illness. Yes, a lot of people claim to have depression, adhd, etc and use it as an excuse for whatever problems they might have. But there are people that actually do have those mental illnesses. Just like there are people who claim to be transgender but don’t actually have the mental illness gender dysphoria. So to me, the “matrix” or whatever you want to call it, pushing everyone to believe they have a mental illness is detrimental to the people who really do struggle with it because it’s now being associated with woke culture. And woke culture doesn’t want to help people with mental illness, it wants to use them.\",\"2:54:56 MEGA BASED statement from Candace\",\"I want a Tate and J.Peterson interview ❤ \\n\\nCandace you re amazing.\",\"I just fell I love with Candace owens ❤❤\",\"I just finished.

He's proud of his past because he's convinced that it's what enables him to do so much \\\"good\\\" today, but then he says he is embarrassed...  \\nAnd it's clear that he feels sorry for nothing he did in his life, which makes him unauthentic and arrogant. The fact that he decided to become a Muslim, a religion founded by someone who took advantage of his position to enhance his sexual access, including a minor, should be enough to at least raise some eye brows. \\nCandace may think that she's doing something just in letting him rehabilitate himself, but the guy is still trying to present himself as an example to all young males.

If you listen carefully to him defending his past actions he contradicts himself in the rest of the interview. Candace has also exposed herself here.

The Bible is ALWAYS right.\",\"I want to say thanks to Candace and Andrew this was a very helpful interview, I think this is the kind of video that should go viral and should be translated to all languages, i know from that it can save lots of lives. Also seen 2 different persons with different ideas and been able to get along is a good example for the world. Please people flood the internet with this interview, God bless you Candace and Andrew, and please Andrew only one wife because that would be 3 more good wives that can be with another 3 good men, 😂❤\",\"Candace is the female version of Andrew. There ideology aligns very well.\",\"I seriously can not believe Candace Owens bowed her knee like this. Where is your Christian Faith Candace? Shouldn’t that come before views why did you go so hard on Cardi B but not a s3x trafficking pedo. He literally has classes on how he corrupts women calling their faith a hurdle to get through to getting them to do cam business. Tucker Carlson and you alike. Did you guys do even a second of research into this guy? Shameful and embarrassing.\",\"Watching him talk about his past videos talking about seducing woman for porn as they are human cargo is priceless. Its like a kid who gets caught taking cookies in front of his parents and saying \\\"what? i didn't do anything.\\\" I think Candace flunked this one. This guy is a legitimate piece of shit who runs get rich quick schemes and he still owns that cam company.

Candace has fantastic interview skills.\",\"As much as I admire Candance for her amazing interviewer skills…this is so hard to watch. This man’s ego takes up way too much room and he paints himself as a victim from the start (« the most scrutinized man in the world in the last 17 months » 🙄). It makes him even more detestable. \\nI will try to watch it entirely to understand why so many people seem to enjoy his content but, for the moment,  I honestly cringe everytime he responds. 😅\",\"I love Candace, and also happy to see these 2 together.

You could really feel the respect Andrew has for Candace, genuinely interested in her opinion.  In all the interviews I’ve seen of him, in very few does it look like he’s actually grown and learned from the experience. Candace one of the few.\",\"Thank you Candace. This here is wonderful journalism 🎉\",\"Candace is a brilliant lady. An intellectual and very articulate. I hope she could see the Truth and Beauty in Islam as Tate sees it. Must approach it with an open heart…\",\"Cannot believe how much I loved this interview! Thank you Candace for giving Andrew a platform.\",\"I’m glad Candace asked about the “change of religion” and I’m glad she was also respectful enough to know not to push on the topic\",\"I'm embarrassed to say I didn't know a thing about this this guy and am guilty of just catching random headlines to make an opinion on him and boy was I wrong, even asked my husband to watch this interview because we support similar conservative views. I think he looked a bit douchey to me, and I judged a book by its cover. Good lesson. I only watched because it was on Candace's channel. Also went on to watch the Tucker Carlson interview,  also good. Thank you, Candace, for bringing this guy's story to light on your platform. Makes me feel sick thinking I'm just another sheep the media had fooled.\",\"I wish more woman had a brain and mindset as Candace !!

Candace if u read this please do Sammy the Bull!!!\",\"Is Candace seriously telling Andrew to Worship the one who was BEGGING TO BE SAVED instead of the ONE ☝🏼 he was BEGGING TO? 🤦🏽\",\"Has Candace actually looked at the case against AT, because it is very clear  that the accusations of trafficking woman go right up to 2021 or more. Why would an intelligent person like Candace overlook such crystal clear accusations of human trafficking?\",\"Thank you for existing Candace ❤\",\"Candace Owens for President\",\"Candace Owens for president\",\"This was the worst interview ever Candace....u really did a terrible job...and allowed him to lie through out the interview.. didn't expected this from you Candace....for this reason I unsubscribed ur channel\",\"Candace interviewing The scumbag pimp? Lost all respect\",\"Seems like he is a good manipulator (based on what is coming out from his mouth). Audience really liked him because he knew how to balance things that will not make people to dislike him. There’s no humility, no repentance to what he has done and said about woman, yes it is in the past and he is proud to not say sorry about it again and again. I watched a part of this interview just to hear what Candace has to say\\u002f ask because interview like this could make him looked guilty or either good person (worldly) and it seems the second one based on the comment section. Christians are not attacking him just to gain viewers, but because he has said things about Christianity which he don’t know much about and that has to be corrected. We all know that there’s a lot of people who claimed to be Christians but not truly living it, and we understood that, same as Islam as what tate is proud of now claiming he has power not like Christianity. Every people has their own faith and also not living on it, but if we based on morals taught by the Bible, there’s a lot of things this man should not be praised or be followed but human as we are, they hear good conversations and worldly encouragement, they will start to like him. This is what one of the Christian apologetics was saying, deceiving people and get their trust. May the Lord bless us with wisdom and humility to seek His truth and righteousness not human who is proud and  not sorry\\u002f repentant for his wrong doings.\",\"The fact that everything was common sense and I got scared that Candace could be cancelled for some things that she said (which was true) shows that we live in an oppressed fake world.

We are of one mind.  Keep saying yhe true things, we need you! 😊\",\"Candace did a good job.  However, there is something about him that grates on me, something I don't like.   Respect to Mz. Owens\",\"*This was an absolute disaster of “pushing back with hard questions”. Just be honest Candace, you hadn’t read the inditement. You hadn’t done any prior research. You did this for the views (which is confusing because haven’t you said your were demonetised by YouTube?)*\",\"Candace owens is a star and an amazing role model and TOPG is out of this world in everything he does and says .

Probs to Candace for this one\",\"Don't know who this guy is, don't want to know who this guy is, don't know how this guy even came up on my feed, don't why Candace has him on.

Thanks Candace and Andrew.\",\"Candace has changed\",\"Candace, I'm Muslim and I love you :)\",\"Funny how Candace ridicules homosexuals who are in loving and monogamous marriages but is entertaining this man who made his empire from pimping out desperate women. Candace is your typical Christian. 0% genuinety and 100% hypocrisy.\",\"just became a huge FAN of Candace.....mad respect.......\",\"Although I do feel Candace is very hard on her own race, while she should be an advocate for blacks instead of demeaning them, she does tell the truth on other issues.  She is very educated within the economic spectrum and I respect her. The George Floyd thing was distasteful. Regardless if he was a drug addict, why rip him apart and then turn around and praise Andrew? Mr. Tate is a good man who has changed but Floyd was on his way to change. But I do respect Candace. She’s great.\",\"I really enjoyed that. Thank you Candace!\",\"W Candace for being a real one\",\"The fact candace has never met a black american chess player makes me wonder.\",\"You're blessed Candace 😊\",\"Shameless. Both of you! It’s okay to admit you did something wrong ten years ago and be sorry about it. Instead of claiming it is “unfair”. Mr Tate did those things, he admitted to it ON CAMERA. \\n\\nIt’s funny how she says “without giving context”…so if a serial killer bragged on camera about his killings, would you be asking for context? My thing is, somethings are actually plain and simple! No need for much talk. I find it disgusting how Candace would criticize women with all her might for being something in the past but she’s here wan****king over Andrew because she likes the guy. \\n\\nIt’s okay for Jay Z to have sold drugs and rap about it but Cardi B is the h*o for rapping about what she once was. 🤦🏽‍♀️ I’m not even a Cardi B fan but it’s the inconsistency that really pisses me d f up.\\n\\nAndrew Tate has done something wrong. Condemn him for it and then talk about how he has stopped. What’s funny is I’m sure her next video would be about Judging a liberal mindlessly defending terrible women while Candace is here on her bench of shame, defending terrible men. As usual. It’s sad that no influential figure understands the term “Balance”. You all just look like a bunch of clowns at the end of the day. Horsesheet!\",\"Candace is her feminine energy. You can see how beautiful it is when a woman is in her feminine energy and isn't as combative as a man.\",\"I totally support Candace Owens work. I just felt that this interview was not an interview. It felt like a game of soft ball between mates, there is evidence it was not all from 10 yrs ago, stuff from 2020. I think that it would have been a very different interview if Ben, Matt, or Jordan was conducting it. No offence to Candace.\",\"Your part of the problem Candace.

Great job at rehabilitating him. He owes you big time.\",\"We love you Candice keep up the amazing work👍🏾🙏🏾🙂👑🏆\",\"I saw a different side of Candace in this interview. I wholeheartedly admire her. She didn't sway the convo with emotions, just gave Andrew a platform to tell his story and say what needed to be said.

Great interview !\",\"I bet everything I have candace won't last a day with a real masculine alfa man!\",\"Candace is great. Incredible interview\",\"I honestly thought Candace, you were going to rip him to shreds so took me a few days to watch it.  I was pleasantly surprised and your willingness to understand his early days and get to know someone who is fighting the same battles as many conservatives over evil.\",\"One thing you’ll notice about Candace is she actually sits quietly listening to the other person as they answer the questions she asked.\",\"Epic fail Candace. Watch his entire video on how he recruited girls. It’s disgusting. There are videos of him from 2020 still pimping girls. You need to back track on this one.

I hope he is held accountable for his actions. I am so disappointed in Candace and have lost respect for her after this interview.\",\"How did I not know about this 😢 glad I subbed and hit the bell I love this goddess Candace Owens ❤\",\"Very professional interview Candace probably the best interview ever. 👏\",\"Candace, you claim to stand for protecting women and their decency. You claim to be a Christian. This person respects none of those things. You've (many times rightly) called people out for less than what he's done. I don't understand why you didn't apply the same standards to Tate as you did with other people, it doesn't make sense what you've done here, and many people hope you will explain soon.\",\"That's pretty bad Candace, this man is a manipulator who used women to make cam videos for him and gain money. And you're here talking to him about god and how women are behaving poorly sexually. The man is literally the whore maker, he's made women who did not want to even show their body in pictures on social media become cam girls for him, because he manipulated their feelings and distanced them from their family, got them broke and desperate to the point of accepting showing their bodies on the internet for HIM to make money off of them. Pretty disgusting. I expected more of you Candace, especially after you called out Steven Crowder. The best I can do is give you the benefit of the doubt and think you didn't do your research before this interview and is being deceived by this horrible man, who's a hypocrite who lies through his teeth the entire interview - he holds none of those values. Sad.\",\"One of the best Andrew Tate interviews, along with Tucker's and Patrick's, thanks Candace! you are a role model for many women, thank God for your life.\",\"Candice needs to learn more about Islam. ☪️\",\"Wow.

I've never seen Candace speak before this interview, so I had my doubts, specifically because I've personally witnessed women hate Andrew Tate for no logical reason, so I was concerned about Candace's approach.\\n\\nAfter watching the entire interview, she's such an inspiration to me. The way she carries herself, the way she speaks with logic and conviction, I'm almost certain she will inspire an entire generation of women and men. I hope her voice is heard all around the world, and she's a Christian!\",\"Good job Candace!\",\"Thank you Candace for your balance and courageous content. Thank you Andrew Tate for being 💯 authentic and completely transparent.\",\"Candace for president\",\"Love Candace …BUT OMG!!! I got anxiety listening to it on her behalf. \\n\\nCandace will NEVER do an interview with him again. I don’t think she realized how self absorbed he is and it became clear in the first 5 minutes that he would talk in circles. \\n\\nI would bet my LIFE that 75 percent of her WHOLE being that if she could have never pursued this interview she would opt for that. But I know she is committed, objective, and extremely professional. She’s Candace. \\n\\nEverything that was said redirected back to the same sentences from him over and over. \\n\\n\\n\\nall I hear from Andrew Tate is “ I, I , I , I’m under attack, I didn’t hurt anyone, I, I, I, I’m not apologizing, I understand the world, I’m very influential, young boys will listen to me, I have had fast cars, I’ve had pretty girls, I’m seen as a hero, I’m imperfect”\\n\\nHe compared himself to Batman, TWICE. \\n\\n5-20 times he said he grew up in a tough life. \\n\\nHow many times is he going to cut Candace off? \\n\\nI’ll be clear. I don’t think Andrew should receive ANY punishment. He is just bad bad vibes as a human and Candace feels it too. I think that George probably asked her in his sweet British accent, “ my dear, can you please never interview that man again? “\\n\\nAnd it was with that they she replied “ agreed” \\n\\nAnd they both turned of the lights at 9pm and slept like a dream.\",\"One thing I noticed right off the bat is Candice immediately showing her love for her man and making sure to let it be known upfront. She brought him with her all the way to Romania without hesitation. \\nOf course her husband could have also asked but when a woman brings her man with to show transparency, that woman is a G, that is a woman you wife up. \\n\\nThis is the very thing the Tates and Fresh & Fit drive home that when a woman truly respects their man she lets the world known of his presence, not like these hoes that have a boyfriends or husbands but act like their single in every day interactions.\",\"I love that Candace doesn’t hide her past & is forthcoming with how\\u002fwhy her values changed.\",\"Who tf is Candace owens and why is she the one to get an interview with the one and only tate 😂\",\"Great interview Candace, you are amazing ❤\",\"Fantastic interview wow, Candace way to go !\",\"Great interview, Candace.\",\"Candace is awesome she is the real one i look up to her she is Courageous\",\"I am open to divergent opinions and am not tribal at all, so I don't compartmentalize groups into left, right. I just personally want to know we're all working for the collective good of the country. That said, I'm rarely a fan of anyone, but instead, the way they reason or do things. I don't follow Candace or A. Tate,  but I know of each and somewhat thinga in the zeitgeist. Candace put on a master class on how an interview should be conducted and provided the much needed 'yin' to this man's 'yang. BBC (and others frankly), take notes. She didn't conclude first and then slant the conversation to affirm her conclusion. This is the absolute first time he was curious about someone else's thoughts on a subject. He was collaborative, he was cooperative and himself, but soft where it fit. He felt safe in not having all the answers. He didn't seem defensive, and he clearly respects her; and it really showed. She earned that respect and not that my opinion matters, but she earned mine...so did he incidentally thanks to her. She gave him the space to be all the things he is, not just one thing. Good on him for doing this with her and damn good job Candace!\",\"Lowkey losing more and more respect for both of these two over time. Wait, never had any for Candice to begin with. Anyway, slow the fuck down you egomaniacs. Just because you and your tight knit homies, wife, husband, etc. agree on something doesn’t mean it’s the down right truth. The real truth is love and it’s always been love. “Objective right” and “objective wrong” okay, but let’s make sure “subjective peace” triumphs over “subjective war” before we fucking kill one another. Goodnight.\",\"Thank you Candace ❤\",\"Been a respectful follower of yours(Candace) for years. \\nAfter some of your videos, particularly the Defending of Rihanna on the Super Bowl while very pregnant,GRABBING at her crotch was disappointing and helped me decide to take a break from your opinions.

I could double like 👍🏻 this ! Amazing interview and interaction god bless you both 🙌🏼❤️💛🤎\",\"I'm disappointed because the interview failed to tackle challenging questions about webcamming or the adult industry. Moreover, it appears biased, particularly since Candace, a self-proclaimed Christian, backs someone like Andrew Tate. He has openly confessed to deceiving others and taking advantage of the emotional vulnerability of women. It's disconcerting when an individual with religious convictions supports someone whose actions go against those values, especially in light of Andrew's own admissions in interviews. \\n\\nI am disappointed also because of the numerous supportive comments. I don't understand how one can support someone who became wealthy by exploiting both men and women and is now facing legal consequences. If he is genuinely convicted because of guilt, then afterward, I really don't know how one can support this person as a Christian.\",\"One of the best interviews that I have ever heard... thank you as you encourage me to be brave in speaking openly and truthfully about the craziness and good in our world!\",\"This was a much needed interview\",\"Great interview, Andrew spent most of the interview looking the other way!

(2:51:30) Where is the evidence that feminists and women who aren't married are all unhappy? (2:53:00) These are three points out of hundreds in this 'interview' that are claimed with zero evidence, and the commenters here are just lapping it up like it's fact.

Great job Candance and Andrew.  What I initially saw was the respect Andrew gives Candace that is so contradicting to what I saw early on when he first came into my peripheral vision on youtube. What I now see is a brutally honest man with great lost values.  I say lost because there is very little of these values portrayed these days unless you were raised by men and women with those values of living a hard life and passing those values down.  This conversation gave me a new view on my grandparents and how they were because of what they lived through and what was passed down.

One of my favorite quotes: \\\"It's all very interconnected...if you were in good physical condition, had the money you were supposed to have, and the mentality you are supposed to have you wouldn't need [porn]. So the reason you are so addicted to it is because everything else in your life is a failure...and this is why they fear male agency so much because when men truly wake up and decide to be the best versions of themselves they're hard to control because all these control mechanisms fall by the wayside. Men who don't want porn, anti-depressants or garbage but actually want truth and honor and respect...are going to want to be brave, they are going to want to do the right thing regardless of how dangerous it is for their own personal circumstance, and that sounds like a difficult population to enslave...\\\"\",\"This was an excellent interview, and hes right.

I really enjoyed the interview, but I lost some respect during the part where you told him that you understood why your fighter friend has a picture of women in a boat etc. Yet, at the same time, later in the interview, you said agreed that the matrix \\u002f government is forcing women to behave like sluts. I noticed that you agreed and bonded with him about creating a persona that young men look up to, that uses women as sluts, but in the same conversation attacked the government \\u002f  matrix \\u002f Hollywood \\u002f media about for supporting or feeding into the propaganda that it’s OK to use women as sluts!? 🤔 \\n\\nPlease help me make that make sense 🤔 \\n\\nIt looks like your bonding with him for one of two reasons: \\n\\n1. Maybe you didn’t have the emotional capacity or strength to tell him how wrong that is to boys. That this persona of using women like property is not the correct way to treat women. \\n\\nOr \\n\\n2. You actually were being double minded. You believe that for your friends and colleagues it’s OK to use women in these fake personas for the publicity of what it is to be masculine etc, and at the same time you think that the government \\u002f matrix \\u002f media whatever is wrong for sexualizing women and using them like they are property and sluts. \\n\\nMaybe you believe both! Who knows! I just lost some respect because you had a chance to tell him that it’s not OK to treat women like property, and all I saw was you negatively bonding with him for some clicks or likes on your page. That’s how I feel. \\n\\nAs a Christian Latina woman who has recently found out about you, I will say that I feel disappointed in how you represented God and women during this video. Not trying to attack you, just explaining how I feel. I am all for meeting broken people where they are and not judging them for their brokenness, but we also have to be careful not to affirm or even accept their brokenness. \\n\\n I feel that’s what you did in this video. So, I dont know how I can support that. 🤷🏻‍♀️ \\n\\n(Excuse my grammar and spelling I’m using my small phone)\",\"My entire perspective has changed. Wow, GREAT interview.\",\"Really great interview\",\"Its so refreshing to see two respectable, educated people talking about the real ugly truth of the world we live in. Thank you both for this interview.\",\"Excellent interview and conversations\",\"Great interview! Strong, intelligent, moral, and ethical. I feel like I understand and agree with your points even stronger than before. I did not realize most of the content shown about Andrew was so dated. I now realize that I am seeing the difference between a young man, and a much wiser individual. Thank you for the opportunity to educate myself on what confusion I had reconciling the man I saw today; and the one I seen in the long past spliced social media clips. I do not watch mainstream media unless I am trying to figure out what they don’t want our focus on. There is a lot to be said about journalistic integrity, and you will not find it in the the mainstream corporate media world.\",\"This is a good interview\",\"Two brilliant people talking about important issues in an eloquent and professional way, I learned a lot and changed my perspective about Andrew Tate, Candace you did an absolutely amazing job hosting this interview.\",\"This interview is one of my favorite this year!!\",\"This was an excellent interview.

I didn’t like that they are judging Harry and assuming things without knowing every detail. In general I think they could have elaborated a bit more on the „liberal“  side the or the „opposition“ and not just mainly be on  the conservative and subjective side. But it still was a good Interview\",\"I just loooovvvveee  how Candice lets Andrew speak without interruption its so refreshing ❤ great interview.\",\"Great Interview with 2 rational, intelligent people!!\",\"Great interview lets make this go viral.\",\"Great interview! I did not find one point I disagreed with.\",\"This is not an interview. This is a 3 hour dick riding promotion video. If you watched this and felt sympathy for Andrew, you just fell for it. Candace prefaces and makes favourable conclusions on behalf of you the viewer even before the question is asked. It's a marketing tactic and you shouldnt fall for it. Every \\\"conservative\\\" gives him a pass. Its infuriating.\\nShe just let him skirt the question and gaslight everyone else around his \\\"webcam\\\" business. There are many many videos of him bragging how he manipulated both the women who work for him and the men that pay for the service. And how he is happy to just f*** them all and take their money. Now everyone is just gonna let him sit there and blame every other website for being \\\"more sexual\\\" than his platform?\\n\\nHis defenders say he is a changed person. And even Candace disappointingly says so...He has not explicitly said he has changed at all, in this same interview hew says he does not regret or apologize for anything he did in the past. So why is everyone trying to put words in his mouth and ride that d***? \\n\\nYou would not give a known scammer your money even if they say they have \\\"reformed\\\". You would not let a \\\"reformed\\\" paedophile babysit your children. So what is this nonsense. Jordan peterson is the only one with the ball s to call him a pimp outright. Now slowly ben and knowles are following suit but they shouldn't have given to tate a pass in the first place. Candace and Walsh still riding that D.\",\"Both hands down, this is a sellout interview.  Garbage.\",\"This is one of the best interviews\\u002fconversations I have seen in a LONG time.\",\"Perhaps the best interview I’ve watched in a long time. Candace Owens handled it marvellously and you could see at times that Andrew Tate was even a little shy with her and that he respected her very much. Her Christianity was also very evident which is wonderful. The comments on marriage were great. He was asking her genuine  questions and being teachable. I would be very interested to see where he is in 5 to 10 years from now.\",\"the absolutre diffrence between this interview  and BBC one is just amazing . the way you interupt each other with respect , the way you listen to eachother's feedback .. i just love it  !  i swear i enjoyed this interview way more than i expected.   great job and and great topics .\",\"Thank you, this is an excellent exihibit of  an interview.\",\"This was an amazing interview!

They show each other so much respect and really seemed to enjoy the banter back and forth. Really starting to like this guy too.  It shows people do grow mentally and that we all are stupid when we're in  our teens and 20s.

I searched both your name and his but got other people who would go crazy over things you and Tate never even meant. The algorithm is real fr fr. Well in Madam….

Both of you so are smart and aware of what is happening in this country. Continue to do the work and spread the truth.\",\"Engaging in an interview that blames women for societal issues and defends figures like Andrew Tate, who has a history of promoting offensive views and pyramid schemes, underscores the potential negative aspects of Candace Owens' approach:\\n\\nExploitative Cash Grab: Hosting an interview that fuels controversy and sensationalism solely for the purpose of gaining attention and monetizing the resulting engagement can be seen as a cynical cash grab that prioritizes profit over ethical discourse.\\nNormalization of Harmful Views: Blaming women for global issues perpetuates harmful stereotypes and detracts from meaningful discussions about societal challenges. Defending someone like Tate, who has a history of promoting pyramid schemes, ignores the harm caused to vulnerable individuals and communities.\\nLegitimizing Questionable Figures: By providing a platform to Andrew Tate without adequately addressing his controversial actions, Owens could inadvertently legitimize his views and validate his behavior, sending a message that such behavior is acceptable.\\nUndermining Constructive Debate: Instead of fostering productive conversations, such an interview might contribute to the further erosion of civil discourse by prioritizing sensationalism and emotional reactions over thoughtful analysis.\\nLoss of Credibility: Associating with figures like Tate, who lack remorse for their actions and promote harmful ideologies, risks damaging Owens' credibility and reputation as a thoughtful commentator.\\nContributing to Division: Hosting an interview that blames women for societal ills and defends questionable individuals can deepen divisions in society and perpetuate harmful narratives that do not contribute to positive change.\\nIn summary, while the allure of attention and financial gain might be motivating factors, it's essential to consider the potential negative consequences of hosting interviews that prioritize controversy and sensationalism over ethical, constructive, and well-informed discussions.\",\"This was a great interview.\",\"A great 3hr watch, this interview isn’t for the weak.\",\"One of the best interviews that I've ever watched.

Yes, Candice asked a few pointed questions, as did he, but I really appreciated the conversational element conducted by both.  Big fan of both and this is exactly what society needs to see.  Tate is great at diagnosing societal ills, but I would love to hear him expand his thoughts on resolution in deeper layers.  You can see he was very controlled and respectful to Candice as there were times when you can see he wanted to interject, but he stopped himself and listened.  I thought this was great on his part.

No real interest in finding out the truth or even pressing him with real hard questions based on the ongoing investigation, legal case, and self-incriminating evidence presented by the prosecutors. This is no different than Cardi B's interview with Joe Biden. Just another pandering to his audience. You are a massive hypocrite.

What are his credentials for saying what he’s saying?  What’s his educational background?  I know nothing about him , but on the basis of just listening to him in this interview I have my first thoughts:\\nSuccessful and rich but lacking any real deep education and learning \\nHis success and wealth have allowed him to be hypocritical and immoral ( his multiple families, whilst are fine in his little fantasy life, make me feel as if he’d be a great gangster or pimp and this sensation is rather unsavoury)\\nHe’d be a great Islamic fundamentalist leader\\nSome of what he says makes some sense and wokeism is leading us down a dangerous path  - however we are no longer living in caves or even in  Jerusalem 2000 years ago….. this man is not our answer to our problems.\\nCandace says what she thinks and has brought the role of women into discussion - it’s an important discussion to have -  but she also must remember that her public platform to say what she thinks is in part thanks to our ancestors’ work regarding women and men who didn’t have any of the opportunities we have today.  She must be a little careful not to spit on the plate that feeds her.  \\nAnd she certainly didn’t call Tate out…… shame!!!   How convenient she wanted him to talk uninterrupted in this interview…… it’s the first time she hasn’t interrupted a man during a discussion……. Is this finally the real Candace?   Quiet, agreeable and submissive.\",\"👏🏾 👏🏾💪🏾🙌🏾 Fantastic, great Interview \\u002f conversation dynamic @Candaceowens & @Andrewtate…\\nThis interview has convinced me to subscribe 👍🏾\",\"We need to see more interviews like this and I also think you can join your platform with others like Carlson and spread the word .

I'm married to a real, strong, fit and healthy man (ex Britains strongest man and MMA coach) and even though he is wealthy from success he does not feel the need to be ostentatious. Therefore, although I agree with a lot of what Andrew Tate says I don't understand why he needs to buy flashy cars and houses if he is truly satisfied. When I was married to my ex husband, who was a weak, metro sexual man not an alpha male I filled my unhappy life with flash cars, clothes and show homes. Those things do not equate to fulfilment and true happiness. We are a lot older than Andrew Tate and maturity definitely makes you value time rather than things. I feel he is just beginning his journey and I'm excited to see how he progresses post flashy cars and yachts 😂😂😂.\\n\\nIt goes without saying I'm a huge fan of Candace and I probably would not have watched this interview for three hours if she was not the podcaster.\",\"Great Interview!\",\"Best interview I’ve heard in awhile\",\"I dont comment on social media... but this interview was amazing!

Loved every minute of this interview!\",\"Great interview\",\"Loved this interview ❤\",\"Candace, I have a high regard of respect for much of the information you put out.  Your conservative values, amidst a decaying society, is one of the many voices needed in our desperate times.  This was a great interview, and I believe you handled it with skill and with an unbias approach.  Though, as a Muslim, i would encourage and implore you to investigate the religion of Islam.  You mentioned in the interview that you do not have much knowledge concerning Islam, but i would argue, as an individual in your capacity, it would be prudent that you at least gain a basic knowledge of the fastest growing religion in the world and why men and women, with strong conservative values are attracted to the Islamic message.  If anything, just for the simple cause of education. Keep up the great work!\",\"It's great to see an interview that fairly presents the information by having a constructive conversation.

Heres my only little question mark point: where he talks about the webcam business and you see the video of him from 10-years ago.

A True MAN.\",\"Candace, well done to you. This was definitely the best interview I’ve seen and to Andrew, keep doing what you’re doing. If you understand what’s going on here then you’re on a journey, as I think if it had to be explained to you, or you didn’t feel enlightened afterwards, well, good luck to you and your endeavours. People use words like, frustration, crossroads, doom, depression the list goes on; but you need a starting point in life regardless of your age and always remember and say it with conviction that you can do it. The best thing about this was we got it for free! This isn’t about materialism, it really isn’t. Who noticed Andrew wasn’t wearing a watch?\",\"The best interview ever watched.\",\"Real and inspiring interview.\",\"First interview I’ve seen with included videos for context, thank you!\",\"It took me 3 days watching this interview (bit by bit). But I did it. I love it. This is the dream team for changing this world for the best\",\"Hi Candice, Look dear, I went to several comments on a different programs on the interview you had with tate on Islam and what took my mind was the courage and confidence of every Muslim in your honesty and saying they believe if you research the Islamic faith you will be muslim dear. Please I want you to take this as advantage to realize what people found in you by researching Islam or take some few moment and visit the Islamic countries I believe you will understand our faith teachings better. Honestly, myself I notice how beautiful you are from heart, for every muslim saying good about you, sure you must be a good hearted person dear. So take the advantage of this beauty of yours and know your real Creator, you are very close to know the Creator of Jesus, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon Muhammad and all the messengers sent to humanity generation after generation. And I love you dear, I am a fellow Africa but not american instead Nigerian. On that interview, you do mentioned some African countries are practicing Christianity strongly, but you really don't know that the Christianity practice in Africa is worldly christianity and ethnic mostly dear. why do you think christianity is strongly practiced and ethnical and religion clash keeps claiming lot of lives much more than america and the entire west where lgbtq+ is bubbling? just look at Rwanda, CAR people are reverting to Islam on the daily bases just because of christianity treatment. Anyway, Anytime you are opportune to visit Nigeria, kindly give me a shout. Best Regards\",\"based interview\",\"Very interesting interview. I was hooked for every moment and all the various topics you talked about.\",\"Absolutely amazing interview, thanks Candace and Top G 🫡🙌\",\"Great interview but he's not really anwswring her questions.

Two people having an open conversation about things transpiring in the world. It’s impressive to see two individuals that share different religions respectfully having an open conversation about their beliefs. This was the most meaningful video I’ve watched on YouTube.

My high school girlfriend literally told me that she was a player in college and that she wanted to get back with me. I tried working out with her and ultimately decided to break up with her because I couldn’t get over the disgustingness.  You 304’s are nasty. Jill, you are nasty.\",\"F’ing love AT.  Ty for speaking up for us men.  We built this world and continue to manage it.  Women need to realize it. What have women invented?\",\"Pretty simple what Andrew is saying: \\\"They\\\" have accomplished two things for profit and power: demonized men, and turned women against us. Men are confused and finally give up. Men are under control. Men are further abused now for not being men! Then women start to suffer and become unhinged. Men want them even less. And that's when the big bucks start rolling in!\\n\\nToo bad our population will implode. Reign over the ashes kinda thing. Pretty tough to sustain a population when going with our prehistorically wired biological desire to have kids with any random American women is the most absurd, self-defeating and riskiest thing any man could do. And the LONGER you're with the same woman, the riskier it becomes for a man to father children in the United States today. Think about that small statement. And it becomes even dumber with each passing day as women just continue to destroy themselves emotionally, for dopamine. The chances of that random woman turning out to be even decent in general, is so incredible low. Maybe a 10% shot. \\n\\nI assume that any woman that looks at me either wants something from me, or conforms to routine girl code that I'm a psychotic raving lunatic serial killer, as are all men, and my only motivation in life is to beat my woman senseless twice a day, six days a week, once on the 7th day, and I get to run around drunk banging all kinds of women, in the back of her car even, if I so choose to take her car when I go out to bang women, like all guys do every night. She better like it too! When I'm not doing any of that, I'm usually searching for any random woman to assualt in public, then I sit and play PS5 while I scream at my bitch to bring me my damn food, then clean me up after I shit myself...cause ya know, video games. C'mon fellas...you know we ALL do this. \\n\\nSeriously, if we're going to be unhappy moving forward, at least we'll be unhappy with money, security and general freedom and without ever looming abuse from a dopamine addicted, unhappy, immature woman who's likely already been with a couple hundred dudes to begin with, or will be at some point. And we generally get to just stop worrying or concerning ourselves with women's safety, needs and general well-being, because it's generally a very bad idea to have that instinct nowadays. \\n\\nNo thanks. Good luck in your eternal quest for power, to dominate each other, be the best, outdo all the competition and become men, which you all have pretty much achieved. That's if you're not also completely obese, which a majority of American women are. Disgusting. Great job girls. Have fun while you all continue to run yourselves in circles and accomplishing nothing but your own emotional, mental, physical and spiritual destruction. Or any chance at kids or just a happy life with a guy. We'll be in the gym getting fit and riding our motorcycles together. And not abusing, competing with or screaming at each other for the sake of excitement and power. \\n\\nMen work together to build, achieve, create and make theirs and the world a better place. Woman work against us, each other and their own biological needs and desires. How absurd can an entire gender be and they still don't get it...because they don't think they have to or ever did. Or frankly, ever will. They want all the power, and zero responsibility. \\n\\nSo sad that women just can't simply be women. What's the solution now? Who knows. Our entire way of life needs to change. It'll take several generations to undo this insanity. I guess until then women will fend for themselves as the ecomony for the little guy continues to implode. Simply eating might eventually become a problem. But your appearance is MOST important in the game, so be sure you all always have money to completely fake everything about your physical appearance. To get guys that don't even want you, at least not long or even medium term. The more paint, the better. Sherwin Williams Duration line is some of the best you can use to make yourselves look as clownish as possible. Men love that. So hot. \\n\\nGood luck ladies.

Example my dad and mom are a multi time world ballroom champion couple. Top of the field. My dad is absolutely old-school Italian masculine. And the first lesson I was ever taught when it came to being a man  AND  dancing, was him telling me that “ on the floor or in life you be masculine. You must lead, you must be strong you must be powerful. You must be dominant and in control of yourself and  the situation. Your partner depends on you for that. Leave 95% of a femininity. To her, she can do it a lot better than you. What you bring to a partnership or anything is masculinity. DONT hide it.

I’m definitely not political myself, but if I were to guess I’d say I’m probably more middle left. I feel like Andrew is middle right which is why I get some of the things he’s saying. And there should definitely be room for masculinity, However, some of the views he shared on mental health, did come off to be a bit on the toxic side of a masculine person. Not everyone needs therapy but not everyone has the capacity to cope in a healthy way with some of their traumatic experiences. Some DO, but some genuinely need to relearn healthy behaviors to get through things to function, so mental health is genuinely valid, no matter how successful you are. Because at some point even if your successful, you will be stunted in some area of your life because of STUCK trauma.  Also, interesting perspective on the arguments being emotional and being in a matriarch society, the only thing I would add is just as Candace mentioned being libertarian allows room for extreme right ideals, the same could be said for the democratic side. Toxic masculinity created matriarch extreme feminism, and the pendulum needs to be right in the middle. That said, there’s nothing wrong with a strong masculine man but there can be room for emotional intelligence which is understanding and healthy communication when expressing one’s feelings and hearing from someone else. If that is accomplished I think more relationships would actually thrive.\",\"I loved listening to this conversation. I didn't agree with few points but I think y'all tried to balance it out.... Y'all are definitely spot on about Masculinity and Femininity and how mainstream media is killing real culture. Now, people are so confused in the west.

He must be a smart bloke.\\\" \\nand i tell you what i agree with alot of what hes saying but its all based it truth and logic just basic interlectual skills that the rest of us lack they used to call it common sense but now everyone gets a prize so youre rewarded for being useless and socially we decline rapidly and you get the idiocracy of today\\n\\ni would be suing four corners Australia for deformation if i were you\",\"It makes me laugh that people in the west support porn\\nAnd calling what Andrew did as sex trafficking 😂😂\\nIsn't porn the same an industry that benefits from broken women \\nThe media in the West is clever to make you think someone is the problem \\nWhen the problem in your whole system \\nAnd it's feeding you to only believe what is saying like brainless robots\",\"He is getting attacked by his victims.  I'm not sure I would support this guy.  Human trafficking isn't just a skeleton in a closet.  He speaks about a video being the only evidence they have but it's not.  It's the out pour of victims.  I can't believe this man's word when so many people are saying it happened.\",\"I don’t get it. He seems like a douche bag.  He ran a trafficking website with naked girls and sold drugs.  He’s in record talking about this many times.  Why exactly is she defending him?\",\"So whats tate business about human trafficking and sex slaves any of it true?\",\"So, what I took away from this was... he was sex trafficking, but conservatively.\",\"\\\"I know what i say is true.\\\" You're a Muslim. Nothing you say is true and the fact your sex trafficking minors says it all. \\n\\nLove you Candice Owns.

It’s funny how early in the video they mentioned porn, which is purely agreed upon without  manipulation and coercion, leads to sex trafficking but him plotting to have sex with a girl to get her to have feelings, which is the exact definition of manipulation and coercion, doesn’t have anything to do with sex trafficking! But I guess that’s being Stoic! 🤔\",\"Its disgusting as fuck that you went easy on andrew tate and didnt push him on any of the trafficking that he was PROVEN to have done. I actually thought the rightwing was better than this and better than the left when it came to rejecting their own extremists. I guess i was wrong, unsubbed, not gonna support someone who supports sex trafficking\",\"No! Either you really don’t understand the law of what human trafficking is (which quotes Lover-boy method as luring someone w\\u002fpromise of relationship\\u002fmarriage for financial gain) you have a vested interest in promoting Andrew Tate, or you’re incredibly naive. This man lied to both you & Tucker (& don’t think we didn’t notice how Tucker was dressed in those hideous straight legs, dawning loafers w\\u002fno socks like a red pill moron). You guys let us down. Suddenly you don’t want to look up someone’s adult past? Since when? C’mon guy’s open your eyes!\",\"Honestly I used to admire Candice Owen's work. But this interview was massively disappointing. There is A LOT of lies that he said. As someone that has seen what the loverboy sex trafficking has done to women, I was so so disappointed with her interview. This man lied to her about what is is being charged with. You can investigate for your selves the actual charges and evidence against him(wich is massive). He would make women fall in love, separate them from their friends and family and slowly groom them to do cam work for him. He is a digital pimp. There are many videos and messages where he explains how he tricks woman into doing only fans. This interview does not at all seem neutral, it seems like she very much is on his side when you research the evidence for your self. I'm shocked that I'm no journalist and I was able to research the charges and evidence that is all public and this woman couldn't do research it for herself. I would suggest yall watch WHAT DO YOU MEME'S page where he breaks down the charges and evidence or DAVID WOOD AND APOSTATE PROPHET. All these people do an amazing job at bringing the recipes.\",\"It was ironic that you work against human trafficking, but give a platform to one also Andrews tates come off as narcissistic.\",\"I wonder how quickly this will get deleted. Y'all need to educate yourselves on what human trafficking is. Andrew Tate himself, has admitted to using what is considered \\\"the loverboy method\\\" in order to manipulate women into doing sex work for him. He is a self proclaimed pimp.\",\"There is so much misleading here 🫠🫠 Candace please be more diligent in doing research or hire someone to do so because there are so many lies here that Andrew just fed you and you were so easily deceived.\\n\\nAlso the thing Andrew did is very well classified as sx trafficking by definition years before Andrew Tate began trafficking women in which he and his brother didn’t stop doing 5-6 years ago, if you did better research you would have found facts that up to a year ago they were still handling girls and doing the cam business.\\n\\nI’ve enjoyed hearing your beliefs because I thought we shared the same convictions but with this interview and seeing how you shrunk back I will be more prudent to receive what you give us as facts.\",\"Sadly enough it seems Candice did hardly any research into this subject. Kinda disappointed honestly, I'm a huge fan of Knowles and Shapiro.\\n\\nFor anyone interested, \\\"Whaddo You Meme\\\" has a 30 minute breakdown of the whole situation. To put it bluntly, the Tate brothers have openly admitted to sex trafficking as recently as 2020 and 2021. Not \\\"being nice to girls\\\" sex trafficking. Manipulating them into whoring themselves out so he can harvest them for money sex trafficking.\\n\\nI won't support the left because they support all sorts of sexual crimes and horrors. If the right is doing the same thing now then they've lost my vote. I'll stay neutral on 2024.\",\"Wow, lots of human trafficking fans here. Watch Warrior Poet Society, “is Andrew Tate a con artist?” And he shows actual footage of Tate bragging about taking millions and millions from men by pimping women. This was barely two years ago.\",\"I don't think that he is guilty of human trafficking, however he is also not a Christian, because he is definitely not humble. Maybe him interacting with Christians will help him to turn to Jesus.\",\"So if they investigate Epstein's human trafficking empire what could they find... maybe some customer names.... Clinton maybe Gates?\",\"Truly disappointed you were interview this man for sex trafficking women. You speak about dumping a dirt bag fiancé (which I whole heartedly agree) to interviewing this sad excuse of a “man” who doesn’t respect women and objectifies them. You’ve lost your conservative female audience. Pride comes before the fall. You have become extremely arrogant and need to ask the Lord to humble your heart.\",\"W sex trafficking PR interview candace!!!!!\",\"So what do you think about his occupation, making money out of the subjugation and trafficking of women.\",\"@RealCandaceO I think it's very disingenuous of you to have Andrew Tate on your show and let him spout of like it was an innocent thing he did 10yrs ago. You're a smart lady. You know how to do your research. It doesnt take too much digging to find out that his Top G special memberships had him giving tutorials in hiw to isolate women to manipulate them into doing what they didnt want - which is the definition of trafficking. For those who want an alternate presentation of Tate https:\\u002f\\u002fyoutu.be\\u002fGpXjs-I05Ss\",\"yall should know that he's actually just full of shit, whilst his message of empowering men IS good, he's guilty af for human sex trafficking. There's no other way around this, this guy is a scummy piece of shit.\",\"Andrew Tate has admitted to Trafficking multiple times.\",\"candace, I'm disappointed in you. it doesn't appear you have done the barest amount of research into what sex trafficking is, nor did you actually challenge him on his abhorrent actions and comments. normally I like your videos but this is not it\",\"What an enormous disappointment. This male is so delusional and a master gaslighter and abuser. His ego is so incredibly huge he thinks people are actually jealous of him and he is not capable of taking accountability for his actions. Candace, from here on please stop pretending to support women and trafficking victims. You BOTH are a JOKE.\",\"Till this day, i still don't understand why they see Andrew's webcam business as human trafficking, all i'm seeing is consensual adults agreeing to be part of softcore porn, there is a huge difference between will and against will, one is a choice and the other is not, those women agreed to be part of his business, it's not manipulation, manipulation is misinformation, and these people that say it's wrong are the same type of people to scream women are smarter then man and make wiser decisions, those women could have most definitely said no, and judging by the amount of women Andrew Tate has been with, it's more likely that there has been women who said no to him in the past.\",\"I think there is a big difference between being nice and seducing a woman so she will have sex with you, and then work for you. It's annoying that he doesn't really acknowledge that! If you study sex traffickers, you will see they all have a very similar tactic. Many of them are the boyfriends of their victims FIRST before they push them into sex trafficking because they rely on that emotional attachment from the women to get what they want. You can be very nice to people without trying to have sex with them. He also doesn't mention how he misled the women into thinking they were getting a higher percentage of the profits than they were by falsely inflating the tax rate. I would respect him if he would just come clean with everything. He is correct that most people have done a lot of bad things.\",\"Ayyyy fighting child trafficking while having a guy who pimps young women for money 🤑🤑. Such a Christian thing to do.\",\"I hope not any boy in the world takes this criminal as his roll modell. He is a disgrace to men all over the world. Trafficking young girls.

Do your own research.  Candace I’m surprised at you. If a man persuades (the lover boy method) a female by love bombing them with the intent to have them do porn in a webcam business that seems like a form of human trafficking. Andrew Tate blatantly lied on this interview. Candace Owens It’s the INTENT not just being nice to bring women to you. Anyone with a half a brain that watches Andrew Tates entire “Lover Boy Instructional Video” would see Tate was NOT just talking about dating a female while he was owning a porn webcam business. He was teaching men his method of deceiving females with the intent to have them do whatever they want them to do on the WebCam business. His intent was to make money and con women out of half of the females money. Correction as much as the money as possible by lying to them about him paying tax liabilities and coning them out of most of the money that was generated  from the webCam videos that they produced. As Tate said ITS LIKE PIMPING THEM BY BEING NICE TO THEM. I’m surprised that OWENS did not fully watch the entire video and Not question Tate on it. I think pimps are degenerates that prey on weak vulnerable woman. I don't care if they do it nice or with violence it's still wrong. I followed and supported Candace and Tate up until this interview. SAD!!!!!\",\"If you allure women with purpose to exploit a woman that is human trafficking anywhere\",\"You have to remember that this is the same man who has admitted to sex trafficking in his own videos. Yes, this is the most popular video you have ever had !! Yet, you have let down so many women. You are almost gushing in front of him !!! Money obviously rules you heart. Bye Candace !!\",\"You discuss seggual trafficking and how that is linked to pron. You know he did that (or still is) and want to brush over the fact that HE PARTICIPATED IN THAT AS WELL!! \\n\\nHe constantly want to compare himself with 'worse' people like drug dealers etc. But that isn't the only evil thing in the world. Manipulation of women, isolating them is also a VERY evil thing to do! He did threatened them with violence if they wanted to leave, used financial control as well. Oh and btw, saying that those videos of TEACHING HOW TO MANIPULATE WOMEN, was meant to be private.... wauw just wauw! I BET a lot of cp was also meant to be private to a private group of predators... \\n\\nHe sounds like a snake because that's what he is. These type of manipulative people never change, they just continue to manipulate. \\n\\nHim constantly comparing himself with other people who has done completely different actions than what he did (so comparing apples with pears) also shows how he's manipulating ms. Owens and the viewers.\\n\\nNah, I can see through the character he's putting up now. I'm not listening to this snake any longer.\",\"With all the trafficking going on this just makes me sick.

Interviewing Andrew Tate and making divisive remarks might attract more attention to her platform, increasing her visibility and sparking discussions.\\nCatering to Supporters: Owens has a base of supporters who appreciate her unapologetic conservative views. An interview with someone like Tate, who shares some of her provocative tendencies, might resonate with this segment of her audience.\\nReinforcing Contrarian Image: Both Owens and Tate often challenge mainstream perspectives. By hosting such an interview, Owens could reinforce her image as a contrarian who isn't afraid to confront prevailing narratives.\\nFueling Debate: Controversial discussions tend to garner more engagement and debate. Owens might see the interview as an opportunity to ignite discussions, both in support of and against her views.\\nExpanding Reach: By discussing a range of topics, including Tate's past actions and controversial statements, Owens could tap into a wider audience interested in sensational news and entertainment.\\nMonetization: Controversial content can lead to increased clicks, views, and engagement, potentially translating into higher revenue from advertising and sponsorship deals.\",\"I’d like to see Andrew Tate as President of the United States and Candace Owens as Vice President!

Orthodox Church has more faith and knowledge of Christ then today’s christians are today. \\nJesus you know is all about Love and Acceptance, that what brought you to your knees , because True Jesus would never accept any of the BS is happening today. You don’t even know that your pastors feed you lies because they have been taught only tops of the iceberg about christianity and when asked questions they cave in and say- My talent is to teach and lead, not to research. Asking questions about religion is a taboo and the fear of all your communities going against you is what holds you from learning about Islam and opening the veils from your eyes. \\n\\nYou don’t have to respond to my comment, as nothing will change anyway from what you will try to find to defend your beLIEf about Jesus you were taught, not what you independently have learnt. \\n\\nIslam will rule the world and “Jesus” Isa be peace upon him will be back to fight alongside with muslims to fight satan. They will pray as Moses did, Jesus did (in the garden before “crucifixion”) read that scripture again and last God’s prophet Muhammad peace be upon them all did. \\nYou don’t have to agree with me, because I am no one.

I agree they have a predominantly strong culture, and I would even agree that I prefer to be in public in Dubai or KSA, because you do not see the obscene public conduct as you do in the USA or western Europe.  However, Islam has a very different God then Christianity, islam has a god that is proud to be a trickster, that says man cannot know if they are saved. Islam is 100% a religion of works, Christianity is a religion that has Christ at the center and is about Grace and faith in Jesus, and through Faith salvation comes. They are very different Gods and very different religions.\"],\"legendgroup\":\"islam\",\"marker\":{\"color\":\"#325A9B\",\"symbol\":\"circle\"},\"mode\":\"markers\",\"name\":\"islam\",\"showlegend\":true,\"x\":[9.285686,9.275495,9.218897,9.851353,9.265102,9.110707,9.296718,9.709778,13.898228,9.392263,10.476288,9.249423,9.475399,9.326443,9.29267,9.393111,9.374503,9.449291,9.630495,9.4045,9.25202,9.217376,12.241435,9.424695,9.160394,9.664837,9.404798,9.411647,9.391908,9.314948,9.725269,9.206317,9.416864,9.431552,9.252806,9.3034,9.310717,9.642429,9.360337,9.649371,9.225507,9.390169,9.460321,12.283402,14.366419,9.454784,9.287999,9.585498,12.259416,9.391694,9.503615,9.932295,14.137768,9.686739,9.3033695,9.38667,9.349709,9.400224,9.731071,11.066286,9.377797,9.463172,10.389306,9.677909,9.73285,9.824489,9.359814,12.188608,9.47303,9.253282,9.725281,9.549552,9.375134,9.330522,9.815469,9.513531,9.893778,9.622808,9.681062,9.720521,9.253068,9.407694,9.147359,9.343404,9.874846,9.379289,9.69283,9.255762,13.885727,9.852668,9.375538,9.353137,9.643852,9.243231,9.841134,9.6661],\"xaxis\":\"x\",\"y\":[11.143279,10.445256,11.045519,10.734681,10.938518,10.692805,10.919113,10.9904,8.719021,10.970798,10.056274,10.455751,10.586702,10.966055,11.025397,10.9459095,10.833569,10.817099,10.984727,10.797062,10.960989,11.016204,6.6176915,10.796166,10.999682,10.864129,10.837068,10.945849,10.815404,11.095759,10.8591585,10.918161,10.9377985,10.668328,11.120238,10.849862,10.9847,10.817116,10.932216,10.90958,11.014944,10.9856415,11.180721,6.7218165,10.19907,10.711068,10.940575,10.743399,6.6572313,10.920015,10.6138735,10.811554,8.672992,11.17989,10.942037,11.002219,10.834773,10.830991,10.726864,9.471649,10.943454,10.732031,11.33539,10.914469,10.811781,10.61971,10.917093,6.6790667,11.186801,10.936391,10.811306,10.886489,11.114915,10.939041,10.773024,10.995311,10.638091,10.737322,10.868812,10.819151,11.097609,10.641633,10.364353,11.036524,11.333942,10.965791,10.614334,10.928759,8.669596,10.688351,10.861588,10.937687,10.837729,11.092899,11.096254,10.91316],\"yaxis\":\"y\",\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hovertemplate\":\"\\u003cb\\u003e%{hovertext}\\u003c\\u002fb\\u003e\\u003cbr\\u003e\\u003cbr\\u003etag=amazing\\u003cbr\\u003eu0=%{x}\\u003cbr\\u003eu1=%{y}\\u003cextra\\u003e\\u003c\\u002fextra\\u003e\",\"hovertext\":[\"Amazing\",\"Amazing\",\"THAT – WAS – AMAZING!!!!!

Makes you realize you’re definitely doing something right! Also, I am Christian and I agree with you about most Christian churches, there are many problems. It’s really an issue and it’s unbelievably difficult to find a church that is actually aligning to the Bible. Literally most of them are now okay with women speaking in church. It’s demonic.

He should be christian\",\"To paint Christians as one and saying that all religious sects are the same and have the same views and ideologies, shows when you claimed to be Christian, you weren’t for very long. Christians are susceptible to corruption. We are all of one flesh. That is why we are to deny ourselves and take up our crosses daily. Jesus never said this world would be easy. Unless a church is ordained by God, and is reading scripture from the pulpit, scripture for scripture, not opinion base, It isn’t a true church of God. There are many apostate churches out there. Why we must read scripture so we aren’t fooled. Jesus is the groom and the church is the bride. That’s why marriage is so important especially when it comes to adultery. Seeking self is that, seeking the world is that. Idolatry is that. Life according to what makes “me” happy is that etc. God gives us blessings and all we need. That’s why people are feeling so empty in the world is because they are searching for themselves. They are lost. For you to hop from one religion to the next and I’m sure to the next. You are too. Always searching. \\n\\nAlso, you can’t talk bad about Christianity saying it’s weak as a whole and then whine about “they are like this and they are attacking me.” You literally just said in the video that that isn’t masculine behavior… \\n\\nThis idea that let’s paint hardship into “I did what I had to” shows no accountability, sure God can use that and bring you to better circumstances but to say that this was theee only options, I highly highly highlyyyy doubt that. God gave you a choice. He gives us all freewill and choices. Webcam girls made you money and lots of it fast. You came from a place of greed. And again with the painting one stroke of a brush and excusing that evil behavior saying that everyone is like you and had to do that, excuses that. When you repent, you are forgiven. God used Tax collectors amongst all of the fallen people of this world to do His Good and to show His Glory. Nobody is irredeemable. When you turn your life over to God and believe in Christ, that’s when forgiveness starts to happen and healing starts for so many. That’s when your only identity isn’t masculinity, it’s Christ. \\n\\nThis judging Christian stigma (well people in general are judgmental—equals sin) but there is a difference between judging and holding people accountable including your self. If we are a true God fearing Christians and our Creator commands us to spread the gospel, we obey. We also come from a place of wanting to help or save. That’s kindness and love. To hate someone is to allow them to have God’s wrath upon them. Hell. I don’t know why people think Christian’s are suppose to be a bunch of kindergarten teachers with feelings either? There is time to be kind and there is a time to have faith like Elijah and completely so like Christ. To stand in faith. Kindness is there but there are people like Elijah and the 850 Baal \\u002fAsherah prophets. Even Christ has had Righteous anger. \\n\\nJesus was born in a stable and rode a donkey. Never needed a horse or mansions. The question is, why strive for the world when it will all pass away. There are the most wealthy people in the world and they are the most lonely. Unfulfilled. What and how you display yourself especially your moral compass, shows what kind of men will follow. All will stand before our creator. Every knee will bow. Jesus is both Lion and Lamb. It’s not weak to be meek. Meek: : enduring injury with patience and without resentment. Jesus was humble on the cross to die for our sins. Selfishness and idolizing masculinity and what it looks like to others will never ever get you to a balance. God is a God of details and numbers. If you question that read Exodus and see how many people have the same chromosomes. Numbers equals balance. Being an extreme to one side is unhealthy and when you need to step up to something bigger than yourself especially for others, that’s when you see what a natural man looks like. Whether brave or coward. What seeds are you planting? The selfless is the stuff that leaders are made up of. Including great husbands and fathers. Which create healthy relationships for future generations. \\n\\nMay God bless you Andrew Tate and may your eyes be truly opened and you find happiness.\",\"Great interview Candace.

Countries like Poland, Georgia, Vatican City, etc are going to be a much better example for Christianity.\",\"Real Christian Churches don't Judge Andrew Tate or anyone like him. Real Christian Churches have several ppl sending someone like me that made bad decisions and spent 13 years of my life in prison for it. They didn't judge didn't ask details, didn't talk about me behind my back, they just said God will forgive me. I'm in that Church a state away and I've been to several others, the Christian BS narrative of them hating certain ppl is BS. Real Christian's don't hate ppl, where are they all at??? Real Christian's speak up when children are getting sacrificed and are able to chop off body parts and have life long consequences for just being confused even though they're 12 but I'm 36 and get carded for alcohol and cigarettes. The Left are against God and mocking God and we are not ok with children being executed and Liberal mainstream disrespects everything about it, The POSPOTUS AND POSVP, defends the shooter and doesn't do anything for the victims because they are evil and sold their souls.

As a Christian I was sad when we lost Andrew to Islam, but I knew the reason he gave was the reason. We as Christian are FAILING Jesus Christ. We are denying him on a mass scale. How can we then expect anyone to become a Christian? Missionary work can be done daily. You don't have to go to a 3rd world country and spread the Word Of God to do Missionary work. Simply living a Christian life, speaking to others about the Lord and NOT shying away from an aggressive conversation against Christianity. Christians need to get back into the fight. We also need to stop allowing Christianity to be hijacked by leftists who demand we must accept them because we are Christians. Jesus didn't turn sinners away, but he didn't allow the sinner to lead him to sin.\",\"as a christian he is completely correct on the problem with christian churches\",\"I am also sad he isn't a Christian anymore.

It’s homes where men are weak that struggle because the women will be trying to protect the children AND be trying to work out who is attacking them - it’s hard to do both.

Therapy helps in many situations however therapy and therapist should never be used as a way to enabler a behavior. It’s to assist or aim in healing. So it’s very harmful to say therapy is bullshit. What would we suggest a sexually abused person do to fix the trauma that springs from that? I’d hope it goes without saying that they didn’t mean in all cases therapy doesn’t help.

But I’m going to say it’s not for everyone. It comes to that we can generalize at some point but some people aren’t in that group. For example. Perhaps there are men who are so just more sensitive and cry and that’s ok but it’s not for every man. In the end, we should just want to do better and be better and there are tools that perhaps can help. For me, therapy and my doctor saved me. And this is important, you HAVE to find good doctors. Like my doctor didn’t want to make me be on meds my entire life. My therapist wanted me to figure things out on what upsets me and how I can be better and control my emotions better. And it took me years to find them but I’m glad I did. Now I’m so much better and completely of medication. My faith has definitely contributed to me being better. So I just wanted to comment that therapy is not evil but I don’t think everyone should have it. And in the end, you just want to be better. Never let whatever you’re diagnosed with bring you down or use it as an excuse. My bosses even said they never would know I have bipolar cause i seem just a normal hard working person. And I am. I just have this part of me that I just spend extra energy to fight against. Sure I’ll have a bad moment or a bad day but you get back up. You do better. In the end, that’s all we can do.

Narcissism, Codependency and scapegoating is a real dynamic and it's playing out on a cultural stage (cough cough cancel culture), some people genuinely suck at having relationships because they're family dynamics were every one for themselves. You guys are talking about service and building influence, you have to actually know how to have other peoples best interests at heart for that to happen otherwise you have a bunch of Putins running the world or left wokeists like that porn couple. Those people need therapy but would never go because it's deemed weak, I get your speaking to the disenfranchised people and trying to empower them but to awaken people we have to give more context. Not everyone wants to be like thier parents or grandparents and for that therapy is essential.it holds weight, don't totally dismiss it.\",\"I really liked listening to these very different perspectives on live and the world in general. Definitely will rethinking a few thing regarding my own habits and goals. \\nJust had to say that not all therapy is bullshit… I was 18 when I was diagnosed with ADHD. I was depressed and self pitying all the time. My therapist was the person that said to me that I had to deal with things and stop being a wimp. At the beginning I hated her but after half a year I started to feel better. She was right and knew exactly what to say to shake me up. She taught  me to understand my  ADHD and to accept the things that happened in the past, because of it. If I hadn’t had her I would probably develop a personality disorder. I was clearly on a downward spiral. So to hear people say therapy is nonsense is just wrong. I know people that don’t really need therapy and are just going to get attention, but it’s not like this with everybody. \\n(I’m from Germany so it’s a real diagnosis not just for pills or so)\",\"1:11:41 Free Game regarding Therapy\",\"We need Jordan Peterson interviewing him. I agree with Andrew Tate on many things, but I still believe that therapy can be very helpful to many people.\",\"@1:11:00 I disagree. If more males had people to talk to help them navigate through life with therapy then there would be less people in jail. I also believe therapists are counselors and should move to help you improve your life to find direction and meaning. This is why the manosphere exists people men aren't heard. Even Kevin Samuels says because we are all flawed you should go to therapy even if everything is going right. 3 months max and don't let it be a clutch\",\"I can only say that two people who haven't received therapy will talk shid about it because they're just scared of whats inside. The rest of the convo is good, that bit was horrendous, and if you're thinking about killing yourself and feeling like any trauma description may indicate, you SHOULD talk it out, not get medicated.\",\"1:04:17 1:05:45 'therapy for average males is teaching men to be women - which is destroying society and men'  1:08:00  'to create weak enslaved men and create mental illness.'\",\"So much of what you say makes sense. However you’re defining wrong about therapy! I had it for a brief period and they taught me to take responsibility and  change my mindset and I’ve not had anxiety since! They actually taught me the strength of mind you talk about! There are good and bad therapists, they’re not all created equal!\",\"I disagree heavily with them on therapy.\\nIf you do therapy you are \\\"weak\\\" for a period but if you don't you might be weak for your entire life.\\nThe research is clear that therapy is effective.\\nThe real problem is that people become so pathological nowadays that they would need therapy. I think if we would have strong loving families and communities again that people won't need therapy as much.\\nThere are cultural and societal problems that when fixed would reduce the population's need for therapy.\",\"Psychology has destroyed our society, justice system, military, schools, families. .. every thing.  It finds an excuse for immoral, irrational, criminal, and self destructive behavior.  Therapy has replaced  close friends, family, and partners. When you have issues - turn to people who actually care about you and not your money.\",\"Therapy that’s not for a disability is just a temporary fix to a consistent problem. 1:08:49\",\"Great interview however, therapy IS NOT a science but, psychology IS. It doesn’t give you the right to do anything it just explains why you are the way you are and again IT IS A SCIENCE if a child is subjected to sexual deviance before adolescence THEY WILL become sexual deviance with out a shadow of a doubt so the alcohol example he gave is actually a really weak example\",\"Wildly bad take to say therapy is bad.

And good for you, but there are many people out there whose life depends on it. Unfortunately the number gets higher by the minute.

Women naturally repsect, admire and adore men who have self-control, self-respect, good manners, excellent grooming, a strong spiritual life and the discipline to pursue spiritual things, a good work ethic, empathy and due consideration for others, loyalty to their family and friends. Nobody could possibly disrespect a man like that, even other men would not. But telling women to respect men and be in a subservient position to them, when those men are lazy, cowardly, fearful, gossiping, disloyal, flakey, constantlt angry and moody, is reinforcing those shitty behaviours. Iron sharpens iron and if your woman is that iron, you need to let her sharpen you occasionally. Don't lament having found a difficult, strong woman who wants your best from you. Let her be a shaping force in your life. Of course don't allow yourself to be thrown off by someone who is just controlling, petulant, shallow amd self-seeking, but if your woman is in her divine feminine (as some call it) and is expecting more from you, pouting and telling her she is controlling, is not going to get you more respect.\",\"1:24:19 \\n\\n“What do you think men want in women?”\\n-\\n\\nRespect goes both ways in any relationship. Disrespect happens when a man is unable to embody his masculinity. And the most important way a man can embody his masculinity I feel is through honesty and integrity, self awareness and MOST importantly EQ. If a man is able to empathize with his partner and respond with compassion and support that too is truly masculine. Respect is earned and goes both ways.
