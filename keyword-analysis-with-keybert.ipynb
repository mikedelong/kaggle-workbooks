Go ahead and celebrate because in really in Iowa last night only showed a very small sample of vote who actually voted for Trump, mean the General Election Nationally could be even smaller. You have no idea who I will vote for therefore don’t just take if for granted that I’m going to vote for Biden, because by doing so still shows just how delusional and a total idiot you are to assume that I planning to cast my vote for Biden, especially after I said that Nikki Haley have more foreign policy experience than DeSantis. The people with Nikki Haley is there is too many people who still doesn’t want to see a woman as President of the United States. See a woman as President is just filled with as much hate of women being in public as people have hatred in see a Democrat in that office. Just shows how so many Americans living in a delusion that a woman can’t do the job as president as well as it wasn’t that long ago when the male white population really didn’t even think that women should even have the right to vote in the first place. In this sense women have became their own worst enemy by buying in to the white male ideology that women should not be president. Great Britain elected a woman as Prime Minister and she were one of the best Prime Minister that ever served Great Britain as well as look at how long England have a queen. Like I said if women ever want to gain respect against white male  needs to get off their high horse and support women rights other wise the will forever be classified as second class citizens. Think about it most male population are too busy ruining the government while the female populations find ways to getting around their screw up to run those male screwup household. Meaning who does a better job but don’t get any respect for doing so. You can continue to assume and live in your Delusion filled will Chaos and Corruption by chasing after lies after lies being told by Donald John Trump without Trump even allowing any one to even asking Trump any questions about anything. If you put you money into a bank account and then find out that a large amount of your funds was slowly disappearing without you spending a dime of it, wouldn’t you start asking questions on where that money is going or would you just sit their like a dumb as as your money vanished into thin air as you are currently doing when it comes to Donald Trump by letting Trump dictate what he want you to do without question and like an idiot you actually do just that. Call me a basement man all you want but at least I’m smart enough to question and smart enough to no when i have been lied too, therefore what is your problem when you cannot extinguish between the truth and a damn lie?\",\"Thank God you won.

I know you don't know me from a hole in the wall, and this is probably not you reading this. But it doesn't matter. I assume it's one of your people. I am a proud conservative of this country. My concern, so that I do not have to post it here, and somehow the message gets removed, is the basis of the movie, 2000 Mules.  I did not need such a movie to bring me to a conclusion of foul play. And evidently, you agree. But that is behind us. However, I am sure I am voicing the thoughts of millions of Americans when I ask, what are we doing to prevent that from happening again? If what you and others proposed is true, what are the people who are willing to come to action doing to prevent that from happening again? In the 3 1\\u002f2 years since the last election, I totally thought we would've heard about something concrete being done to prevent it from happening again. A change of laws, a round up of volunteers from every city and town across this country to monitor polling places or drop boxes for the next election, anything… Anything to prevent it from happening again!  But we are 10 months away from the next presidential election, and I am already beginning to hear the term \\\"early voting\\\"!  As I said above, I am a nobody. But there are millions of nobodies who are willing to stand with you, and with other conservatives, in preventing this from happening again! Where is the leadership to tell us what to do? Where is the leadership to guide us and let us know how we can help!?                                                                             Thank you, Carol Bresciani\",\"De love you Donald!

You don't have to like Donald j Trump as a person but let's face it he showed us before he is the right man for the president of the United States of America.

Both Trump and Biden have had a term to show us who they are.\\n\\nLet's look at which of the contenders' exercise power most closely resembles that of a fascist totalitarian:\\n\\n*  Which one arrested his political opponents?\\n\\n*  Which one mandated unwanted \\\"medical treatment\\\" - forcible penetration with a now-known-dangerous substance?\\n\\n*  Which one has kept political prisoners in jail for  3 years WITHOUT trial?  That this admin will not try these cases offers proof positive that they know their accusations would not stand up to evidence.  \\n\\n*  Which administration had its FBI raid school board meetings?\\n\\n*  Under which administration did the FBI classify Catholics as 'terror' threats?\\n\\n*  Which one has taken money from Communist China and Russia?\\n\\n*  Which one weaponized the DOJ as a means for delegitimizing his political opponent?\\n\\n*  Which one began his term by destroying hard-won American energy Independence\\u002fexports by crippling exploration and production?   BTW - Which one made a campaign promise of doing this damage?\\n\\nThe impact of American oil independence and exports was felt worldwide in two, stabilizing ways:\\n1.  America no longer had to bow in supplication before nations who hated us \\n2.  The power of the Iranian mullahs, DERIVED ENTIRELY FROM OIL, was greatly diminished.  \\n\\nThe energy independence and export power achieved under Trump and because of Trump's policies made the Abraham Accords possible, bringing the possibility of peace and stability to the Middle East closer than ever before. \\n\\n* Which administration has started three wars?\\n\\n*  Which administration conspired with social media to censor the speech of its political opposition?\\n\\n*  Which one called its political adversaries; the  MAGA half of the USA,  'terrorists'?\\n\\n*  Whose administration has done more damage to the American economy and middle class?\\n\\n*  Which administration has flooded the USA with illegal immigrants comprised largely of single, military-aged men from foreign countries' jails and prisons?\",\"I believe Daddy Trump gonna pull it off in 2024..Just my prediction\",\"For all of you in Iowa who braved the weather to get out and vote for Trump God Bless you.

It’s called a contingent election.\\n\\nA contingent election is the process put in place to deal with the eventuality in which no presidential candidate reaches the threshold of 270 votes in the electoral college.

Unlike his colleagues, Casler thwarted his nondisclosure agreement, enabling him to tell us the unvarnished truth about Trump:\\n\\nHe's [Trump] incontinent from all the speed, all the Adderall he does, the cocaine that he has done for decades. All that stuff has a laxative effect on your bowels and his are uncontrollable.\\n\\nCasler said that Trump has been wearing 'diapers since probably the 90s'. Adding that they often had to stop the show in order for Trump to change his diaper, Casler said that Keith Schiller's job was to take Trump offset and wipe him down. \\\"Our nickname for Keith was wet wipes.\\\"\\n\\nCasler added that Trump does it and he almost sits there unaware of it, and one time he saw Ivanka have to kind of go whisper in his ear and then Keith came and took him offstage.\\n\\nTrump not cleaning himself when changing out Depends, it is because he wears a hard plastic girdle and he doesn't have the freedom of movement. It's why you see him turn his body from the waist so strangely when standing.\\n\\nHe would soil himself often after flying into a rage and cursing out the Script Dept because he couldn’t read a word. One time there was the word 'arbitrage' on a cue card and he freaked out and started screaming that the script department was setting him up then very loudly evacuated his bowels and you could smell it.\\n\\nI should also mention that Casler originally came out about this in 2019 (around the start of the pandemic), but the story was mostly buried. This discourse was reignited by a recent tweet from former Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger:\\n\\nI’m genuinely surprised how people close to Trump haven’t talked about the odor.

I finally received a court date in 2017. I lost almost 4 years of my son’s life and after this court date, it was ordered I get my son back.\\n2016: My middle son (Morgun) ran away & found me – He told me they were being held captive, manipulated, lied too, and abused.\\n2017: The Allen’s were to return Payden to me, although the father held a gun to his own autistic son’s head and threatened his life the night before he was to return him, if he decided to come home. Payden just turned 18 and had legal rights to decide where he wanted to live!!!! Those rights were taken from him, myself, and my side of the family by not being able to see my sons for almost 4 years. Payden was in fear for his life, as his father held a gun to his head, punched a hole in his chest, where now he continues to have chest pains from the fractures to his sternum. \\n2022: We had Payden’s trial on 03\\u002f22\\u002f2022 and it was a small town where everyone knew the grandparents & father, most of the people on the jury knew them too. Judge Pat Phelam of Levelland, TX Criminal court allowed the D.A. to throw things in the courtroom, call names and act like a 4 year old. As well as let the state have whatever witness they wanted to call, although would NOT allow any of our witnesses be called. We had multiple people ready to testify and would only let Payden and myself speak. This was a small town rigged trial (Voir Dire was a joke) I need everyone’s help seeking justice for a self-defense case – They charged my son with 47 years prison time for self-defense! Help me share his story and find justice! Brandie Allen – allenbrandie@hotmail.com email me if you find it in your heart to help fight this injustice! \\nThank you from the bottom of my heart! \\nFIGHT INJUSTICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Victoria acerta!\",\"Congratulations! 🎉\",\"Donald Trump's attorney stuns the world by arguing that Trump could order \\\"S.E.A.L. Team 6 to assassinate a political rival\\\" without consequence if Congress then chose not to impeach him.\\n\\nWe are in dark, uncharted waters now...\\n\\nAttorney John D. Sauer was arguing to a judge that Trump has some kind of \\\"presidential immunity\\\" that insulates him from criminal consequences.\\n\\nPushing back on the patently absurd idea — which would turn presidents into de facto kings who are above the law — one of the appellate judges asked a hypothetical question.\\n\\n\\\"Could he order SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival?\\\" asked the judge. \\\"That's an official act, an order to SEAL Team Six.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He would have to be and would speedily be, you know uh, impeached and convicted before the criminal prosecution,\\\" claimed Sauer.\\n\\nRead that again. Sauer is claiming that if Trump used Navy Seals to kill a Democratic rival he would be immune to prosecution unless Congress impeached and convicted him.\\n\\nIn other words, a Republican-controlled House or Senate could completely let him off the hook. And they would, just like they let him off the hook for the the January 6th insurrection.\\n\\n\\\"What if he weren't [impeached and convicted]? There would be no criminal prosecution? No criminal liability for that?\\\" responded the judge.\\n\\nThe lawyer then served up a word salad of legalese to avoid the question and the judge cut in.\\n\\n\\\"I asked you a yes or no question,\\\" she said. \\\"Could a president who ordered SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival who was not impeached, would he be subject to a criminal prosecution?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If he were impeached and convicted first,\\\" the attorney insanely replied.\\n\\n\\\"So your answer is no?\\\" said the judge.\\n\\nThe lawyer then went on to speak in circles again, but his point had been made clear. He is essentially arguing that presidents can do whatever they want so long as they have a compliant Congress unwilling to impeach them.\\n\\nThis is terrifying. Just imagine what abuses of power Trump will get up to if he is allowed back into the White House.\\n\\n2024 will not come down to a choice between Biden or Trump. The choice will squarely be between Biden or Authoritarianism. Full stop.\",\"God bless President Trump\\nOur President.\",\"America loves you!!!\",\"So proud of you tonight.

However, within a few weeks, not only were there attacks on democratic state institutions, and many basic principles of the Polish Constitution were violated, but there was also a radical threat to freedom of speech. The first political prisoners have emerged. Institutional and increasingly physical violence is replacing the debate. Politicians, the judiciary, and even private businesses are being intimidated.\\n\\n \\n\\nAfter years of communism, Poland struggled to rebuild its democratic institutions, casting off the yoke of the totalitarian past imposed by Moscow's occupiers. Despite significant economic progress, changes in some areas were slow and not without serious mistakes, especially in the judiciary. To this day, individuals responsible for the repression during the martial law of the communist regime still sit in the courts, despite their advanced age.\\n\\n \\n\\nCriticism of the ongoing changes united parties that recently assumed power in Poland. However, instead of improving democratic standards, we are witnessing an attack on democratic state institutions and a dangerous threat to freedom of speech.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe new government's first decision was the forcible takeover of public media. According to Polish law, these media outlets should be managed by government-independent institutions, with specified terms outlined by Polish law. However, individuals appointed by the government disrupted the signal of the main news television channel, and, with the help of hired private security personnel, forcibly removed the legal boards of the media outlets. They were not allowed to return to work even after court decisions declared the government's actions illegal.\\n\\n \\n\\nHundreds of journalists are unable to work, and dozens have already been dismissed. The ruling coalition's camp also organizes attacks on private media critical of its actions, using familiar mechanisms of defamation and intimidation seen in authoritarian regimes.\\n\\n \\n\\nAt the beginning of the year, the police stormed the presidential palace, arresting two members of the parliament without the knowledge and consent of the president, who were persecuted for fighting corruption. Both parliamentarians have undertaken a hunger strike, and their lives are in danger.\\n\\n \\n\\nThese arrests would not have been possible without the government rejecting the decision of the Polish Constitutional Court, which had previously deemed the actions against the members of the parliament illegal. A similar decision was made by the chamber of the Supreme Court designated for this purpose by law, and both parliamentarians were pardoned by the president.\\n\\n \\n\\nUnfortunately, the will of neither of these key institutions for Polish democracy has been respected. The Speaker of the Sejm, representing the government majority, ordered the trial to be held in an unauthorized chamber of the Supreme Court, the only chamber still occupied by individuals responsible for the repression during the martial law of 1981.\\n\\n \\n\\nA significant number of prosecutors and judges refuse to succumb to pressure from the new government, leading to further unlawful acts. The leadership of the prosecutor's office was completely unlawfully stripped of power, contrary to the law. The Minister of Justice is attempting to obstruct the actions of independent prosecutors seeking to investigate allegations against the new government.\\n\\n \\n\\nThere are serious signs of intimidation of private businesses as well, especially those that could be associated with initiatives unfavourable to the government. The independence of the Central Bank is under threat, and decisions of the Polish Constitutional Court are completely ignored.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor many people in Poland and around the world, it is shocking that politicians who came to power with slogans of improving Polish democracy and restoring the rule of law are implementing standards reminiscent of those seen today in Belarus or Russia.\\n\\n \\n\\nPoland is heading in a dangerous direction, jeopardizing the most basic civil rights, and undermining democratic institutions. Such actions cannot be accepted in the name of any political plan. These actions must be met with the opposition of the international public opinion.\",\"Republican nominee is all 10 more months and the the truth shall prevail!!.\",\"Congratulation 👏🎉 we should not celebrate yet 👍🇺🇸\",\"🇺🇸 I stand with my president trump ❤️\",\"The BEST man wins .. !!!! bloody awesome\",\"Good job IOWA\",\"Hallelujah!!!\",\"Congrats 🍾\",\"So happy\",\"And we all thank IOWA for sure…\",\"Easy Peasy!

If you would just try being a little bit like jfk, Ronald reagan, or yes, even Bill Clinton, you would gain the respect and love of many more Americans. Try being a little bit self-deprecating once in awhile. People like that. You don't have to continuously be on the offensive. Try using some humor. Don't be like the Democrats who only know how to hurt and hate people. Please try it. It just may work. Good luck.\",\"Here's to WE THE PEOPLE of our GREAT NATION!!!

I’m a supporter and many times I ask “why didn’t you just stop before the rude or smart rear comment “  Many times you are your own worst enemy because you just don’t know when to stop moving your mouth and that turns people off, you need to recruit more than republicans to win, democrats, independents, undecided voters.

I assume it's one of your people. I am a proud conservative of this country. My concern, so that I do not have to post it here, and somehow the message gets removed, is the basis of the movie, 2000 Mules.  I did not need such a movie to bring me to a conclusion of foul play. And evidently, you agree. But that is behind us. However, I am sure I am voicing the thoughts of millions of Americans when I ask, what are we doing to prevent that from happening again? If what you and others proposed is true, what are the people who are willing to come to action doing to prevent that from happening again? In the 3 1\\u002f2 years since the last election, I totally thought we would've heard about something concrete being done to prevent it from happening again. A change of laws, a round up of volunteers from every city and town across this country to monitor polling places or drop boxes for the next election, anything… Anything to prevent it from happening again!  But we are 10 months away from the next presidential election, and I am already beginning to hear the term \\\"early voting\\\"!  As I said above, I am a nobody. But there are millions of nobodies who are willing to stand with you, and with other conservatives, in preventing this from happening again! Where is the leadership to tell us what to do? Where is the leadership to guide us and let us know how we can help!?

Sorry to keep this post long but here's how I look at it if you need an operation and your face with two surgeons the first surgeon is the best of the best now he doesn't have good bedside manner he might come in spend a minute with you and then hand you off to his nurse then you have the neck surgeon Great bedside manner takes time to speak with you at the end of the day who do you want to perform your surgery that is a no-brainer you want the best of the best. You don't have to like Donald j Trump as a person but let's face it he showed us before he is the right man for the president of the United States of America. Who cares about a mean tweet when your gas prices are down your interest rates are down you feel safe in your own country.\",\"I love United States Donald Trump Power￼\",\"The comic Noel Casler worked on Celebrity Apprentice for six seasons. Unlike his colleagues, Casler thwarted his nondisclosure agreement, enabling him to tell us the unvarnished truth about Trump:\\n\\nHe's [Trump] incontinent from all the speed, all the Adderall he does, the cocaine that he has done for decades. All that stuff has a laxative effect on your bowels and his are uncontrollable.\\n\\nCasler said that Trump has been wearing 'diapers since probably the 90s'. Adding that they often had to stop the show in order for Trump to change his diaper, Casler said that Keith Schiller's job was to take Trump offset and wipe him down. \\\"Our nickname for Keith was wet wipes.\\\"\\n\\nCasler added that Trump does it and he almost sits there unaware of it, and one time he saw Ivanka have to kind of go whisper in his ear and then Keith came and took him offstage.\\n\\nTrump not cleaning himself when changing out Depends, it is because he wears a hard plastic girdle and he doesn't have the freedom of movement. It's why you see him turn his body from the waist so strangely when standing.\\n\\nHe would soil himself often after flying into a rage and cursing out the Script Dept because he couldn’t read a word. One time there was the word 'arbitrage' on a cue card and he freaked out and started screaming that the script department was setting him up then very loudly evacuated his bowels and you could smell it.\\n\\nI should also mention that Casler originally came out about this in 2019 (around the start of the pandemic), but the story was mostly buried. This discourse was reignited by a recent tweet from former Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger:\\n\\nI’m genuinely surprised how people close to Trump haven’t talked about the odor. It’s truly something to behold. Wear a mask if you can.\\n\\ninmate  #P01135809  #Trump  #STINKY #letsgoBRAdon  #TrumpSmells \\n #magamindvirus can be cured … stop eating his 💩 and educate yourself\",\"Trump all the way!!\",\"Trump the world love you too 🥰\",\"Trump is having more followers here more than other trump groups I'm impressed he has more voters here other people dont like my grammar in other groups cause I have faith in jesus & God & Trump.\",\"Love Trump ❤️\",\"Love you trump !\",\"WE THE PEOPLE want Trump!\",\"Sorry...but I think I.

Go ahead and celebrate because in really in Iowa last night only showed a very small sample of vote who actually voted for Trump, mean the General Election Nationally could be even smaller. You have no idea who I will vote for therefore don’t just take if for granted that I’m going to vote for Biden, because by doing so still shows just how delusional and a total idiot you are to assume that I planning to cast my vote for Biden, especially after I said that Nikki Haley have more foreign policy experience than DeSantis. The people with Nikki Haley is there is too many people who still doesn’t want to see a woman as President of the United States. See a woman as President is just filled with as much hate of women being in public as people have hatred in see a Democrat in that office. Just shows how so many Americans living in a delusion that a woman can’t do the job as president as well as it wasn’t that long ago when the male white population really didn’t even think that women should even have the right to vote in the first place. In this sense women have became their own worst enemy by buying in to the white male ideology that women should not be president. Great Britain elected a woman as Prime Minister and she were one of the best Prime Minister that ever served Great Britain as well as look at how long England have a queen. Like I said if women ever want to gain respect against white male  needs to get off their high horse and support women rights other wise the will forever be classified as second class citizens. Think about it most male population are too busy ruining the government while the female populations find ways to getting around their screw up to run those male screwup household. Meaning who does a better job but don’t get any respect for doing so. You can continue to assume and live in your Delusion filled will Chaos and Corruption by chasing after lies after lies being told by Donald John Trump without Trump even allowing any one to even asking Trump any questions about anything. If you put you money into a bank account and then find out that a large amount of your funds was slowly disappearing without you spending a dime of it, wouldn’t you start asking questions on where that money is going or would you just sit their like a dumb as as your money vanished into thin air as you are currently doing when it comes to Donald Trump by letting Trump dictate what he want you to do without question and like an idiot you actually do just that. Call me a basement man all you want but at least I’m smart enough to question and smart enough to no when i have been lied too, therefore what is your problem when you cannot extinguish between the truth and a damn lie?\",\"Thank God you won.

I know you don't know me from a hole in the wall, and this is probably not you reading this. But it doesn't matter. I assume it's one of your people. I am a proud conservative of this country. My concern, so that I do not have to post it here, and somehow the message gets removed, is the basis of the movie, 2000 Mules.  I did not need such a movie to bring me to a conclusion of foul play. And evidently, you agree. But that is behind us. However, I am sure I am voicing the thoughts of millions of Americans when I ask, what are we doing to prevent that from happening again? If what you and others proposed is true, what are the people who are willing to come to action doing to prevent that from happening again? In the 3 1\\u002f2 years since the last election, I totally thought we would've heard about something concrete being done to prevent it from happening again. A change of laws, a round up of volunteers from every city and town across this country to monitor polling places or drop boxes for the next election, anything… Anything to prevent it from happening again!  But we are 10 months away from the next presidential election, and I am already beginning to hear the term \\\"early voting\\\"!  As I said above, I am a nobody. But there are millions of nobodies who are willing to stand with you, and with other conservatives, in preventing this from happening again! Where is the leadership to tell us what to do? Where is the leadership to guide us and let us know how we can help!?                                                                             Thank you, Carol Bresciani\",\"De love you Donald!

Both Trump and Biden have had a term to show us who they are.\\n\\nLet's look at which of the contenders' exercise power most closely resembles that of a fascist totalitarian:\\n\\n*  Which one arrested his political opponents?\\n\\n*  Which one mandated unwanted \\\"medical treatment\\\" - forcible penetration with a now-known-dangerous substance?\\n\\n*  Which one has kept political prisoners in jail for  3 years WITHOUT trial?  That this admin will not try these cases offers proof positive that they know their accusations would not stand up to evidence.  \\n\\n*  Which administration had its FBI raid school board meetings?\\n\\n*  Under which administration did the FBI classify Catholics as 'terror' threats?\\n\\n*  Which one has taken money from Communist China and Russia?\\n\\n*  Which one weaponized the DOJ as a means for delegitimizing his political opponent?\\n\\n*  Which one began his term by destroying hard-won American energy Independence\\u002fexports by crippling exploration and production?   BTW - Which one made a campaign promise of doing this damage?\\n\\nThe impact of American oil independence and exports was felt worldwide in two, stabilizing ways:\\n1.  America no longer had to bow in supplication before nations who hated us \\n2.  The power of the Iranian mullahs, DERIVED ENTIRELY FROM OIL, was greatly diminished.  \\n\\nThe energy independence and export power achieved under Trump and because of Trump's policies made the Abraham Accords possible, bringing the possibility of peace and stability to the Middle East closer than ever before. \\n\\n* Which administration has started three wars?\\n\\n*  Which administration conspired with social media to censor the speech of its political opposition?\\n\\n*  Which one called its political adversaries; the  MAGA half of the USA,  'terrorists'?\\n\\n*  Whose administration has done more damage to the American economy and middle class?\\n\\n*  Which administration has flooded the USA with illegal immigrants comprised largely of single, military-aged men from foreign countries' jails and prisons?\",\"I believe Daddy Trump gonna pull it off in 2024..Just my prediction\",\"For all of you in Iowa who braved the weather to get out and vote for Trump God Bless you.

Unlike his colleagues, Casler thwarted his nondisclosure agreement, enabling him to tell us the unvarnished truth about Trump:\\n\\nHe's [Trump] incontinent from all the speed, all the Adderall he does, the cocaine that he has done for decades. All that stuff has a laxative effect on your bowels and his are uncontrollable.\\n\\nCasler said that Trump has been wearing 'diapers since probably the 90s'. Adding that they often had to stop the show in order for Trump to change his diaper, Casler said that Keith Schiller's job was to take Trump offset and wipe him down. \\\"Our nickname for Keith was wet wipes.\\\"\\n\\nCasler added that Trump does it and he almost sits there unaware of it, and one time he saw Ivanka have to kind of go whisper in his ear and then Keith came and took him offstage.\\n\\nTrump not cleaning himself when changing out Depends, it is because he wears a hard plastic girdle and he doesn't have the freedom of movement. It's why you see him turn his body from the waist so strangely when standing.\\n\\nHe would soil himself often after flying into a rage and cursing out the Script Dept because he couldn’t read a word. One time there was the word 'arbitrage' on a cue card and he freaked out and started screaming that the script department was setting him up then very loudly evacuated his bowels and you could smell it.\\n\\nI should also mention that Casler originally came out about this in 2019 (around the start of the pandemic), but the story was mostly buried. This discourse was reignited by a recent tweet from former Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger:\\n\\nI’m genuinely surprised how people close to Trump haven’t talked about the odor.

I finally received a court date in 2017. I lost almost 4 years of my son’s life and after this court date, it was ordered I get my son back.\\n2016: My middle son (Morgun) ran away & found me – He told me they were being held captive, manipulated, lied too, and abused.\\n2017: The Allen’s were to return Payden to me, although the father held a gun to his own autistic son’s head and threatened his life the night before he was to return him, if he decided to come home. Payden just turned 18 and had legal rights to decide where he wanted to live!!!! Those rights were taken from him, myself, and my side of the family by not being able to see my sons for almost 4 years. Payden was in fear for his life, as his father held a gun to his head, punched a hole in his chest, where now he continues to have chest pains from the fractures to his sternum. \\n2022: We had Payden’s trial on 03\\u002f22\\u002f2022 and it was a small town where everyone knew the grandparents & father, most of the people on the jury knew them too. Judge Pat Phelam of Levelland, TX Criminal court allowed the D.A. to throw things in the courtroom, call names and act like a 4 year old. As well as let the state have whatever witness they wanted to call, although would NOT allow any of our witnesses be called. We had multiple people ready to testify and would only let Payden and myself speak. This was a small town rigged trial (Voir Dire was a joke) I need everyone’s help seeking justice for a self-defense case – They charged my son with 47 years prison time for self-defense! Help me share his story and find justice! Brandie Allen – allenbrandie@hotmail.com email me if you find it in your heart to help fight this injustice! \\nThank you from the bottom of my heart! \\nFIGHT INJUSTICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

All three times. \\n\\nAnd the Christians believed Jesus when He said that He has no pleasure in the death of the wicked. \\n\\nAnd the Christians believed Jesus when He said that He does not want any sinner to die. \\n\\nAnd the Christians believed Jesus when He said \\\"Woe unto you which desire The Day of The LORD; for The Day of The LORD is darkness and not light.\\\" \\n\\nAnd the Christians believed Jesus when He said that every sin will be forgiven, not theirs only, but the sins of the whole world. \\n\\nAnd the Christians believed Jesus when He said \\\"For God so loved the world.\\\" \\n\\nAnd the Christians believed Jesus when He said \\\"Go into the highways and the hedges and invite to my wedding all kinds of people, both good and bad, and my wedding will be furnished.\\\" \\n\\nAnd the Christians believed Jesus when He said that they were evil and God alone is good. \\n\\nAnd the Christians considered everyone as better than themselves. \\n\\nAnd the Christians didn't consider anything that they owned as their own. \\n\\nAnd the Christians didn't sue anyone in court and the Christians who were sued in court gave more than asked for by the people who sued them. \\n\\nAnd the Christians took the wrong. \\n\\nAnd the Christians believed Jesus when He said \\\"Woe unto you which have small children and infants in those days.\\\" \\n\\nAnd the Christians turned the other cheek then leapt for joy and rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer for the Name of Christ Jesus their God and King. \\n\\nAnd the Christians prayed \\\"Forgive them Father, they don't know what they are doing.\\\" \\n\\nAnd the Christians believed Jesus when He said the evil in the world was going to wax worse and worse; they knew that Donald Trump (insert  any publican, y'all encourage your children to be harlots the way you encourage them to be publicans [someone paid with money collected as taxes]) and their vote would not change what God promised would happen. \\n\\nAnd the Christians believed Jesus when He said the people who return evil (a bullet to the face is evil) for evil, are not His disciples and have built their house on the sand and God promises that their house will greatly fall. \\n\\nAnd the Christians didn't idolize their children, parents, families, friends and neighbors because they feared God more than they feared men and death. \\n\\nAnd the Christians believed Jesus when He said the new heaven was better than this life. \\n\\nAnd the Christians believed Jesus when He said that life begins when our fleshly bodies die. \\n\\nAnd the Christians believed Jesus when He said that if He wanted to kill someone, He would have His angels from heaven do the killing, not His humans from earth. \\n\\nThe sermon on the mount (Matthew chapters 5, 6 and 7) takes 15 minutes to listen to, acts takes 2 hours 19 minutes, romans takes 1 hour 1 minute, Corinthians takes 1 hour 40 minutes, galatians takes 19 and a half minutes, ephesians takes 19 minutes, philippians takes 14 and a half minutes, colossians takes 12 minutes 40 seconds, Thessalonians takes 17 minutes 47 seconds, Timothy takes 26 minutes 47 seconds, Titus takes 6 minutes 20 seconds, philemon takes 3 minutes, Hebrews takes 41 minutes 21 seconds, James takes 14 minutes 55 seconds, Peter takes 27 minutes, John takes 20 and a half minutes, revelation takes 1 hour 10 minutes and 28 seconds AND THEY ALL SAY THE SAME THING.

Victoria acerta!\",\"Congratulations! 🎉\",\"Donald Trump's attorney stuns the world by arguing that Trump could order \\\"S.E.A.L. Team 6 to assassinate a political rival\\\" without consequence if Congress then chose not to impeach him.\\n\\nWe are in dark, uncharted waters now...\\n\\nAttorney John D. Sauer was arguing to a judge that Trump has some kind of \\\"presidential immunity\\\" that insulates him from criminal consequences.\\n\\nPushing back on the patently absurd idea — which would turn presidents into de facto kings who are above the law — one of the appellate judges asked a hypothetical question.\\n\\n\\\"Could he order SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival?\\\" asked the judge. \\\"That's an official act, an order to SEAL Team Six.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He would have to be and would speedily be, you know uh, impeached and convicted before the criminal prosecution,\\\" claimed Sauer.\\n\\nRead that again. Sauer is claiming that if Trump used Navy Seals to kill a Democratic rival he would be immune to prosecution unless Congress impeached and convicted him.\\n\\nIn other words, a Republican-controlled House or Senate could completely let him off the hook. And they would, just like they let him off the hook for the the January 6th insurrection.\\n\\n\\\"What if he weren't [impeached and convicted]? There would be no criminal prosecution? No criminal liability for that?\\\" responded the judge.\\n\\nThe lawyer then served up a word salad of legalese to avoid the question and the judge cut in.\\n\\n\\\"I asked you a yes or no question,\\\" she said. \\\"Could a president who ordered SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival who was not impeached, would he be subject to a criminal prosecution?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If he were impeached and convicted first,\\\" the attorney insanely replied.\\n\\n\\\"So your answer is no?\\\" said the judge.\\n\\nThe lawyer then went on to speak in circles again, but his point had been made clear. He is essentially arguing that presidents can do whatever they want so long as they have a compliant Congress unwilling to impeach them.\\n\\nThis is terrifying. Just imagine what abuses of power Trump will get up to if he is allowed back into the White House.\\n\\n2024 will not come down to a choice between Biden or Trump. The choice will squarely be between Biden or Authoritarianism. Full stop.\",\"God bless President Trump\\nOur President.\",\"America loves you!!!\",\"So proud of you tonight.

However, within a few weeks, not only were there attacks on democratic state institutions, and many basic principles of the Polish Constitution were violated, but there was also a radical threat to freedom of speech. The first political prisoners have emerged. Institutional and increasingly physical violence is replacing the debate. Politicians, the judiciary, and even private businesses are being intimidated.\\n\\n \\n\\nAfter years of communism, Poland struggled to rebuild its democratic institutions, casting off the yoke of the totalitarian past imposed by Moscow's occupiers. Despite significant economic progress, changes in some areas were slow and not without serious mistakes, especially in the judiciary. To this day, individuals responsible for the repression during the martial law of the communist regime still sit in the courts, despite their advanced age.\\n\\n \\n\\nCriticism of the ongoing changes united parties that recently assumed power in Poland. However, instead of improving democratic standards, we are witnessing an attack on democratic state institutions and a dangerous threat to freedom of speech.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe new government's first decision was the forcible takeover of public media. According to Polish law, these media outlets should be managed by government-independent institutions, with specified terms outlined by Polish law. However, individuals appointed by the government disrupted the signal of the main news television channel, and, with the help of hired private security personnel, forcibly removed the legal boards of the media outlets. They were not allowed to return to work even after court decisions declared the government's actions illegal.\\n\\n \\n\\nHundreds of journalists are unable to work, and dozens have already been dismissed. The ruling coalition's camp also organizes attacks on private media critical of its actions, using familiar mechanisms of defamation and intimidation seen in authoritarian regimes.\\n\\n \\n\\nAt the beginning of the year, the police stormed the presidential palace, arresting two members of the parliament without the knowledge and consent of the president, who were persecuted for fighting corruption. Both parliamentarians have undertaken a hunger strike, and their lives are in danger.\\n\\n \\n\\nThese arrests would not have been possible without the government rejecting the decision of the Polish Constitutional Court, which had previously deemed the actions against the members of the parliament illegal. A similar decision was made by the chamber of the Supreme Court designated for this purpose by law, and both parliamentarians were pardoned by the president.\\n\\n \\n\\nUnfortunately, the will of neither of these key institutions for Polish democracy has been respected. The Speaker of the Sejm, representing the government majority, ordered the trial to be held in an unauthorized chamber of the Supreme Court, the only chamber still occupied by individuals responsible for the repression during the martial law of 1981.\\n\\n \\n\\nA significant number of prosecutors and judges refuse to succumb to pressure from the new government, leading to further unlawful acts. The leadership of the prosecutor's office was completely unlawfully stripped of power, contrary to the law. The Minister of Justice is attempting to obstruct the actions of independent prosecutors seeking to investigate allegations against the new government.\\n\\n \\n\\nThere are serious signs of intimidation of private businesses as well, especially those that could be associated with initiatives unfavourable to the government. The independence of the Central Bank is under threat, and decisions of the Polish Constitutional Court are completely ignored.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor many people in Poland and around the world, it is shocking that politicians who came to power with slogans of improving Polish democracy and restoring the rule of law are implementing standards reminiscent of those seen today in Belarus or Russia.\\n\\n \\n\\nPoland is heading in a dangerous direction, jeopardizing the most basic civil rights, and undermining democratic institutions. Such actions cannot be accepted in the name of any political plan. These actions must be met with the opposition of the international public opinion.\",\"Republican nominee is all 10 more months and the the truth shall prevail!!.\",\"Congratulation 👏🎉 we should not celebrate yet 👍🇺🇸\",\"🇺🇸 I stand with my president trump ❤️\",\"The BEST man wins .. !!!! bloody awesome\",\"Good job IOWA\",\"Hallelujah!!!\",\"Congrats 🍾\",\"So happy\",\"And we all thank IOWA for sure…\",\"Easy Peasy!

If you would just try being a little bit like jfk, Ronald reagan, or yes, even Bill Clinton, you would gain the respect and love of many more Americans. Try being a little bit self-deprecating once in awhile. People like that. You don't have to continuously be on the offensive. Try using some humor.

If you would learn to drop all the holier than thou attitudes and attacks through name calling of your opponents, you could increase your favorable ranking. Your snide comments don’t sit well with a lot of people and just learn to stop talking. You don’t always need to have the last word, when you make that last statement you come across as not very like able. I’m a supporter and many times I ask “why didn’t you just stop before the rude or smart rear comment “  Many times you are your own worst enemy because you just don’t know when to stop moving your mouth and that turns people off, you need to recruit more than republicans to win, democrats, independents, undecided voters.  Your values don’t need to change, just put a better dressing that people like, I guarantee it will work.  The arrogance doesn’t cut it.

You have no idea who I will vote for therefore don’t just take if for granted that I’m going to vote for Biden, because by doing so still shows just how delusional and a total idiot you are to assume that I planning to cast my vote for Biden, especially after I said that Nikki Haley have more foreign policy experience than DeSantis. The people with Nikki Haley is there is too many people who still doesn’t want to see a woman as President of the United States. See a woman as President is just filled with as much hate of women being in public as people have hatred in see a Democrat in that office. Just shows how so many Americans living in a delusion that a woman can’t do the job as president as well as it wasn’t that long ago when the male white population really didn’t even think that women should even have the right to vote in the first place. In this sense women have became their own worst enemy by buying in to the white male ideology that women should not be president. Great Britain elected a woman as Prime Minister and she were one of the best Prime Minister that ever served Great Britain as well as look at how long England have a queen. Like I said if women ever want to gain respect against white male  needs to get off their high horse and support women rights other wise the will forever be classified as second class citizens. Think about it most male population are too busy ruining the government while the female populations find ways to getting around their screw up to run those male screwup household. Meaning who does a better job but don’t get any respect for doing so. You can continue to assume and live in your Delusion filled will Chaos and Corruption by chasing after lies after lies being told by Donald John Trump without Trump even allowing any one to even asking Trump any questions about anything.

Save our Democracy ❤️\",\"A month ago, parliamentary elections were held in Poland, in which a coalition of parties advocating for the improvement of democratic standards and the restoration of the allegedly endangered rule of law came to power. However, within a few weeks, not only were there attacks on democratic state institutions, and many basic principles of the Polish Constitution were violated, but there was also a radical threat to freedom of speech. The first political prisoners have emerged. Institutional and increasingly physical violence is replacing the debate. Politicians, the judiciary, and even private businesses are being intimidated.\\n\\n \\n\\nAfter years of communism, Poland struggled to rebuild its democratic institutions, casting off the yoke of the totalitarian past imposed by Moscow's occupiers. Despite significant economic progress, changes in some areas were slow and not without serious mistakes, especially in the judiciary. To this day, individuals responsible for the repression during the martial law of the communist regime still sit in the courts, despite their advanced age.\\n\\n \\n\\nCriticism of the ongoing changes united parties that recently assumed power in Poland. However, instead of improving democratic standards, we are witnessing an attack on democratic state institutions and a dangerous threat to freedom of speech.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe new government's first decision was the forcible takeover of public media. According to Polish law, these media outlets should be managed by government-independent institutions, with specified terms outlined by Polish law. However, individuals appointed by the government disrupted the signal of the main news television channel, and, with the help of hired private security personnel, forcibly removed the legal boards of the media outlets. They were not allowed to return to work even after court decisions declared the government's actions illegal.\\n\\n \\n\\nHundreds of journalists are unable to work, and dozens have already been dismissed. The ruling coalition's camp also organizes attacks on private media critical of its actions, using familiar mechanisms of defamation and intimidation seen in authoritarian regimes.\\n\\n \\n\\nAt the beginning of the year, the police stormed the presidential palace, arresting two members of the parliament without the knowledge and consent of the president, who were persecuted for fighting corruption. Both parliamentarians have undertaken a hunger strike, and their lives are in danger.\\n\\n \\n\\nThese arrests would not have been possible without the government rejecting the decision of the Polish Constitutional Court, which had previously deemed the actions against the members of the parliament illegal. A similar decision was made by the chamber of the Supreme Court designated for this purpose by law, and both parliamentarians were pardoned by the president.\\n\\n \\n\\nUnfortunately, the will of neither of these key institutions for Polish democracy has been respected. The Speaker of the Sejm, representing the government majority, ordered the trial to be held in an unauthorized chamber of the Supreme Court, the only chamber still occupied by individuals responsible for the repression during the martial law of 1981.\\n\\n \\n\\nA significant number of prosecutors and judges refuse to succumb to pressure from the new government, leading to further unlawful acts. The leadership of the prosecutor's office was completely unlawfully stripped of power, contrary to the law. The Minister of Justice is attempting to obstruct the actions of independent prosecutors seeking to investigate allegations against the new government.\\n\\n \\n\\nThere are serious signs of intimidation of private businesses as well, especially those that could be associated with initiatives unfavourable to the government. The independence of the Central Bank is under threat, and decisions of the Polish Constitutional Court are completely ignored.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor many people in Poland and around the world, it is shocking that politicians who came to power with slogans of improving Polish democracy and restoring the rule of law are implementing standards reminiscent of those seen today in Belarus or Russia.\\n\\n \\n\\nPoland is heading in a dangerous direction, jeopardizing the most basic civil rights, and undermining democratic institutions. Such actions cannot be accepted in the name of any political plan. These actions must be met with the opposition of the international public opinion.\"],\"legendgroup\":\"democracy\",\"marker\":{\"color\":\"#FECB52\",\"symbol\":\"circle\"},\"mode\":\"markers\",\"name\":\"democracy\",\"orientation\":\"v\",\"showlegend\":true,\"x\":[2.1520882,2.0401254],\"xaxis\":\"x\",\"y\":[6.5890865,5.4562087],\"yaxis\":\"y\",\"type\":\"scatter\"},{\"hovertemplate\":\"\\u003cb\\u003e%{hovertext}\\u003c\\u002fb\\u003e\\u003cbr\\u003e\\u003cbr\\u003ekeyword=history\\u003cbr\\u003eu0=%{x}\\u003cbr\\u003eu1=%{y}\\u003cextra\\u003e\\u003c\\u002fextra\\u003e\",\"hovertext\":[\"We love you.make our country great again.sir..bless you on our journey to make history.\"],\"legendgroup\":\"history\",\"marker\":{\"color\":\"#636efa\",\"symbol\":\"circle\"},\"mode\":\"markers\",\"name\":\"history\",\"orientation\":\"v\",\"showlegend\":true,\"x\":[1.3309827],\"xaxis\":\"x\",\"y\":[6.3654037],\"yaxis\":\"y\",\"type\":\"scatter\"},{\"hovertemplate\":\"\\u003cb\\u003e%{hovertext}\\u003c\\u002fb\\u003e\\u003cbr\\u003e\\u003cbr\\u003ekeyword=loved\\u003cbr\\u003eu0=%{x}\\u003cbr\\u003eu1=%{y}\\u003cextra\\u003e\\u003c\\u002fextra\\u003e\",\"hovertext\":[\"You are Loved in this Country!!\\nGet in the White House again, please!\",\"loved the mugshot, you marshmallow circus peanut candy looking chowderhead\"],\"legendgroup\":\"loved\",\"marker\":{\"color\":\"#EF553B\",\"symbol\":\"circle\"},\"mode\":\"markers\",\"name\":\"loved\",\"orientation\":\"v\",\"showlegend\":true,\"x\":[0.9417618,-3.744999],\"xaxis\":\"x\",\"y\":[6.2437286,7.056997],\"yaxis\":\"y\",\"type\":\"scatter\"},{\"hovertemplate\":\"\\u003cb\\u003e%{hovertext}\\u003c\\u002fb\\u003e\\u003cbr\\u003e\\u003cbr\\u003ekeyword=faithful\\u003cbr\\u003eu0=%{x}\\u003cbr\\u003eu1=%{y}\\u003cextra\\u003e\\u003c\\u002fextra\\u003e\",\"hovertext\":[\"\\\"Well done, My good and faithful servant.\\\"\"],\"legendgroup\":\"faithful\",\"marker\":{\"color\":\"#00cc96\",\"symbol\":\"circle\"},\"mode\":\"markers\",\"name\":\"faithful\",\"orientation\":\"v\",\"showlegend\":true,\"x\":[-0.78294754],\"xaxis\":\"x\",\"y\":[6.687606],\"yaxis\":\"y\",\"type\":\"scatter\"},{\"hovertemplate\":\"\\u003cb\\u003e%{hovertext}\\u003c\\u002fb\\u003e\\u003cbr\\u003e\\u003cbr\\u003ekeyword=drill\\u003cbr\\u003eu0=%{x}\\u003cbr\\u003eu1=%{y}\\u003cextra\\u003e\\u003c\\u002fextra\\u003e\",\"hovertext\":[\"Congratulations on the tremendous win!

Sauer was arguing to a judge that Trump has some kind of \\\"presidential immunity\\\" that insulates him from criminal consequences.\\n\\nPushing back on the patently absurd idea — which would turn presidents into de facto kings who are above the law — one of the appellate judges asked a hypothetical question.\\n\\n\\\"Could he order SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival?\\\" asked the judge. \\\"That's an official act, an order to SEAL Team Six.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He would have to be and would speedily be, you know uh, impeached and convicted before the criminal prosecution,\\\" claimed Sauer.\\n\\nRead that again. Sauer is claiming that if Trump used Navy Seals to kill a Democratic rival he would be immune to prosecution unless Congress impeached and convicted him.\\n\\nIn other words, a Republican-controlled House or Senate could completely let him off the hook. And they would, just like they let him off the hook for the the January 6th insurrection.\\n\\n\\\"What if he weren't [impeached and convicted]? There would be no criminal prosecution? No criminal liability for that?\\\" responded the judge.\\n\\nThe lawyer then served up a word salad of legalese to avoid the question and the judge cut in.\\n\\n\\\"I asked you a yes or no question,\\\" she said. \\\"Could a president who ordered SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival who was not impeached, would he be subject to a criminal prosecution?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If he were impeached and convicted first,\\\" the attorney insanely replied.\\n\\n\\\"So your answer is no?\\\" said the judge.\\n\\nThe lawyer then went on to speak in circles again, but his point had been made clear. He is essentially arguing that presidents can do whatever they want so long as they have a compliant Congress unwilling to impeach them.\\n\\nThis is terrifying. Just imagine what abuses of power Trump will get up to if he is allowed back into the White House.\\n\\n2024 will not come down to a choice between Biden or Trump.

Those rights were taken from him, myself, and my side of the family by not being able to see my sons for almost 4 years.

As well as let the state have whatever witness they wanted to call, although would NOT allow any of our witnesses be called.
