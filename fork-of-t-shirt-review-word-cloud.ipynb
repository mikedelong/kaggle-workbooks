Unfortunately, all three had some kind of problem. The clothing itself was fine, but the printing was bad: one was supposed to be gold lettering but came out as a mustardy brown, one was supposed to be a bright red, sharp logo and instead came out as a very fuzzy-edged 'tomato soup' light orange color, and the last item was supposed to have bright pink text, but it came out as a pale muted pink, changing in shade across the print itself, AND with the print crooked and misaligned on the chest.

The mask itself doesn't fit. It's too big, no elasticity, just a generic shaped cloth mask, and pretty useless unfortunately. It does look nice hanging from the rear view mirror of my car though.

The tag reads \\\"L\\\" but this is the smallest large t-shirt I have ever seen. There is no way it will fit my friend that I ordered it for. I am wodering if I was sent a child size large? In addition the quality of the shirt is poor. Very thin and sort of rough feeling. Lastly when I held the shirt up to take a good look at it there are red colored blotches across the front bottom of the shirt. It looks like it was possibly burned when they were applying the words.

It got there another four days after and sat another three days before it was shipped to my hometown. All-in-all it took the better part of a month to receive it.

Art was really nice. Paid for premium shirts.Beware!Premium does not mean nice thick comfy t-shirts.Very thin, almost see through, and sizing is very off.All my personal t's are XL, these I could have used 2XL.Overall very disappointed.I wish there were descriptions of all t's, not just premium.It would make a very nice undershirt but not tee shirt to wear on its own.UPDATE:TeePublic reached out to me when they learned of my dissatisfaction of their product.Their communication and follow through was top notch.They understood my problem and rectified it quickly without question.Based on my experience with them I would highly recommend them.My only qualm is the description of the t-shirts.There is only a description of the premium, if there was a description of the replacement shirts I received (which I still don't know) I don't believe we would have had an issue.\",\"I don't normally buy printed t-shirts, but I found one I had to have and ordered.

I ordered a good mix of clothing types (including kids sizes). The print quality is horrible. Think printed-at-home-using-iron-on-transfers bad. The designs look good from far but within speaking distance they are blurry and subpar. Their sizing chart is off for sweatshirts, raglans, and premium shirts. If you dare order those, size up. I haven't washed any of them yet but I'm afraid to as I'm sure the prints will rinse right off. I will NOT be ordering again.UPDATE: I contacted customer service and they (almost immediately) sent a new order with larger sizes for the items that were too small. Pretty impressed with that level of customer service! I am adding a star and will update again when I receive the new order and check for print quality. If everything looks good I'll bump it up another star.LAST UPDATE: Everything fits well but prints are all the same blurry quality. I guess that's just as good as it gets from this company.

I highly recommend them for yourself or as gifts for friends\\u002floved ones.5 stars always.\",\"Shipping was fast, but once shirts were here, I feel they run smaller than posted sizes.The 2 shirts I got for myself were a little snug for being XL.The other 2 shirts I got for my son are going to be Christmas presents, so I hope they fit him better when he can try them on.Also, the designs\\u002foverlays on the shirts seemed a little off center and slightly crooked.I will wear them, since they are cute, but glad I didn't pay full price for them.\",\"The sizes of my shirts were a bit too small and a friendly representative online ordered me replacements I'm a timely fashion at no further cost.Very appreciated\",\"Came quickly.

Tee Public reached out and replaced the shirts with the right size!The were courteous and backed their product as promised. The shirts are super soft and the graphics are really well done and I can tell will hold for the life of the shirt.A little slow to respond but to be expected in our current climate maybe.This will be my \\\"go to\\\" T Shirt company forever!\",\"Reached out to you about a spot on tee shirt I just ordered, you got right back to me and the replacement was great! Thank you\",\"fast delivery on a custom made to order product. Good quality shirt.\",\"The only con out of the way: shipping is slower than I m used to, however I m also spoiled by Prime. So it might take 7 or 8 days to get the order, which, in reality, is not too bad. So the con is not really even a con, if you can settle down and wait a week. That s not easy to do because the shirts are fantastic! I only ordered tri-blend so that s all I can speak to, but they re wonderful shirts. Very soft, also tagless (always a bonus), with a somewhat vintage look to the prints. The fit is also great. Nothing bad I can say about the quality, look, or feel of these shirts. I bought six, which is no easy feat because the cart empties after 15 minutes (I had to do it twice, second time I just opened a bunch of tabs, then hit the add cart button\",\"Trustworthy.

Perfection!\",\"I ordered a tshirt for my daughter for Christmas.The size that came in was what I ordered but seemed smaller than I would have liked.I reached out and they immediately sent me out a larger size!!Just wrapped it and it's under the tree for tomorrow :-)\",\"Very pleased with the policy for returns and exchanges!\",\"I've just received my second lot of tees from TeePublic since December and I'm genuinely surprised by how good they are when compared with other stores of this kind. The quality of even the standard tees is great and the prints look as good after multiple washes as they did upon receiving them. The cherry on top is that my orders have both arrived within 2-3 days. My only criticisms of the store would be that they operate an Australian store, yet send emails promoting US pricing and also add GST at checkout, which I didn't think was allowed here. It's also a shame that search functionality is so random and difficult to filter and that I can't seem to create a wish list for later. All in all, though, I do love TeePublic and definitely recommend them to anyone looking for unique t-shirt designs you can't find anywhere else.\",\"So cute.

Unfortunately, all three had some kind of problem. The clothing itself was fine, but the printing was bad: one was supposed to be gold lettering but came out as a mustardy brown, one was supposed to be a bright red, sharp logo and instead came out as a very fuzzy-edged 'tomato soup' light orange color, and the last item was supposed to have bright pink text, but it came out as a pale muted pink, changing in shade across the print itself, AND with the print crooked and misaligned on the chest. Not good! I think they use subcontractors to print and maybe I just got a bad one, but the quality control is so awful (3 for 3!) that I definitely won't be ordering again.\",\"I did not receive an item ordered on day it said it was.

The material wasn't the best quality, but that's not really important. The design was faded a bit around the edges, as if the printing was off-centre. Again, not terribly important and something I was willing to overlook because the price was pretty cheap ( 7). I wasn't expecting much, and not much is exactly what I got. The mask itself doesn't fit. It's too big, no elasticity, just a generic shaped cloth mask, and pretty useless unfortunately. It does look nice hanging from the rear view mirror of my car though.

Thought I'd take advantage of it as a speedier means of receiving what I paid for. I was WRONG. Two days later I got the email that it was sent; but UPS had not even created a label or received the package for another six days. Then the package was immediately given to \\\"Mail Innovations\\\" to be sent through the USPS, and their station had not received the package for yet another four days. There it sat for about a week before it started moving. Then I get notice that it's next stop was Madison WI. Here, hoping I would get it soon checked the tracking, and Madison only got notice of it arriving. It got there another four days after and sat another three days before it was shipped to my hometown. All-in-all it took the better part of a month to receive it. When I contacted customer support, I got boilerplate and canned responses and told where I could check the tracking of the package. I mentioned that's where I got the info of it not even being delivered to the UPS or Mail yet, and got pretty much an \\\"oh well\\\".

The cherry on top is that my orders have both arrived within 2-3 days. My only criticisms of the store would be that they operate an Australian store, yet send emails promoting US pricing and also add GST at checkout, which I didn't think was allowed here. It's also a shame that search functionality is so random and difficult to filter and that I can't seem to create a wish list for later.

I've unsubscribed from all your mailing lists, but I still get more and more emails from you. You lost another star because every single online place I go, I see ads from you. That tells me you've sold my information to more companies than there are fish in the sea.I have a shortcut on my homepage for your site. That's all I need. Please leave me alone! Your like a bad date that won't stop calling!\",\"T-shirt immediately started to get pulls under the arms the first day wearing it with strings coming out.

I tried half a dozen times over a few weeks, then wrote it off as lost money and cut TeePublic out of my shopping.There's too many sites that offer similar products, so I'm not bothered by having to go elsewhere in order to have assurance that simple mistakes can and will be responded to and rectified.Besides, some of the shirts I've gotten from them in the past I've started to notice have worn terribly, the print flaking after only moderate use\\u002fwashes.

I ordered a good mix of clothing types (including kids sizes). The print quality is horrible. Think printed-at-home-using-iron-on-transfers bad. The designs look good from far but within speaking distance they are blurry and subpar. Their sizing chart is off for sweatshirts, raglans, and premium shirts. If you dare order those, size up. I haven't washed any of them yet but I'm afraid to as I'm sure the prints will rinse right off. I will NOT be ordering again.UPDATE: I contacted customer service and they (almost immediately) sent a new order with larger sizes for the items that were too small. Pretty impressed with that level of customer service! I am adding a star and will update again when I receive the new order and check for print quality. If everything looks good I'll bump it up another star.LAST UPDATE: Everything fits well but prints are all the same blurry quality. I guess that's just as good as it gets from this company.

My only criticisms of the store would be that they operate an Australian store, yet send emails promoting US pricing and also add GST at checkout, which I didn't think was allowed here. It's also a shame that search functionality is so random and difficult to filter and that I can't seem to create a wish list for later.

Unfortunately, all three had some kind of problem. The clothing itself was fine, but the printing was bad: one was supposed to be gold lettering but came out as a mustardy brown, one was supposed to be a bright red, sharp logo and instead came out as a very fuzzy-edged 'tomato soup' light orange color, and the last item was supposed to have bright pink text, but it came out as a pale muted pink, changing in shade across the print itself, AND with the print crooked and misaligned on the chest.

I wasn't expecting much, and not much is exactly what I got. The mask itself doesn't fit. It's too big, no elasticity, just a generic shaped cloth mask, and pretty useless unfortunately. It does look nice hanging from the rear view mirror of my car though. The shipping took weeks, probably a month or a bit more. The whole experience was pretty meh, bland.

Thought I'd take advantage of it as a speedier means of receiving what I paid for. I was WRONG. Two days later I got the email that it was sent; but UPS had not even created a label or received the package for another six days. Then the package was immediately given to \\\"Mail Innovations\\\" to be sent through the USPS, and their station had not received the package for yet another four days. There it sat for about a week before it started moving. Then I get notice that it's next stop was Madison WI. Here, hoping I would get it soon checked the tracking, and Madison only got notice of it arriving. It got there another four days after and sat another three days before it was shipped to my hometown. All-in-all it took the better part of a month to receive it. When I contacted customer support, I got boilerplate and canned responses and told where I could check the tracking of the package. I mentioned that's where I got the info of it not even being delivered to the UPS or Mail yet, and got pretty much an \\\"oh well\\\".
