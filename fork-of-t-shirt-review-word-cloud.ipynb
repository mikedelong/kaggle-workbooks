The color was good and it said what I had requested but my first thought was that I had been sent a small instead of a large,which is what I ordered. The tag reads \\\"L\\\" but this is the smallest large t-shirt I have ever seen. There is no way it will fit my friend that I ordered it for. I am wodering if I was sent a child size large? In addition the quality of the shirt is poor. Very thin and sort of rough feeling.

The color was good and it said what I had requested but my first thought was that I had been sent a small instead of a large,which is what I ordered. The tag reads \\\"L\\\" but this is the smallest large t-shirt I have ever seen. There is no way it will fit my friend that I ordered it for. I am wodering if I was sent a child size large? In addition the quality of the shirt is poor. Very thin and sort of rough feeling. Lastly when I held the shirt up to take a good look at it there are red colored blotches across the front bottom of the shirt. It looks like it was possibly burned when they were applying the words.
