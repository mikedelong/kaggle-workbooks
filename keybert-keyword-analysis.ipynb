for a possible screenplay in, and during the voyage on the bus she had to go potty, and  she was in the bus's tiny potty in the rear of the bus going about her private business of  going potty, as she later testified, and even though it was the height of winter she had  the little window of the potty wide open, for reasons Lenz predicts Green doesn't want  to hear about, on the northbound bus, and how this was one of the last years of  Unsubsidized ordinational year-dating, and the final fiscal year that actual maintenance-  work had ever been done on the infernous six-lane commuter-ravaged Commonwealth  Route 24 from Fall River to Boston's South Shore by the pre-O.N.A.N.ite Governor  Claprood's Commonwealth Highway Authority, and the Greyhound bus encountered a  poorly marked UNDER CONSTRUCTION area where 24 was all stripped down to the  dimpled-iron sheeting below and was tooth-rattlingly striated and chuckholed and torn  up and just in general basically a mess, and the poorly marked and unflag-manned  debris plus the excessive speed of the northbound bus made it jounce godawfully, the  bus, and swerve violently to and forth, fighting to maintain control of what there was of  the road, and passengers were hurled violently from their seats while, meanwhile, back  in the closet-sized rear potty, Mrs. Lenz, right in the process of going potty, was hurled  from the toilet by the first swerve and proceeded to do some high-velocity and human-  waste-flinging pinballing back and forth against the potty's plastic walls; and when the  bus finally regained total control and resumed course Mrs. Lenz had, freakishly enough,  ended up her human pinballing with her bare and unspeakably huge backside wedged  tight in the open window of the potty, so forcefully ensconced into the recesstacle that  she was unable to extricate, and the bus continued on its northward sojourn the rest of  the way up 24 with Mrs. Lenz's bare backside protruding from the ensconcing window,  prompting car horns and derisive oratory from other vehicles; and Mrs. Lenz's plaintiff  shouts for Help were unavailed by the passengers that were arising back up off the floor  and rubbing their sore noggins and hearing Mrs. Lenz's mortified screams from behind  the potty's locked reinforced plastic door, but were unable to excretate her because the  potty's door locked from the interior by sliding across a deadbolt that made the door's  outside say OCCUPIED\\u002fOCCUPADO\\u002fOCCUPE, and the door was locked, and Mrs. Lenz  was wedged beyond the reach of arm-length and couldn't reach
